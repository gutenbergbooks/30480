<h2><a name="JONATHAN_F_KELLY" id="JONATHAN_F_KELLY"></a>A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE LATE JONATHAN F. KELLY.</h2>


<p>The life of a literary man offers but few points upon which even
the pens of his professional brethren can dwell, with the hope of
exciting interest among that large and constantly increasing class
who have a taste for books. The career of the soldier may be
colored by the hues of romantic adventure; the politician may
leave a legacy to history, which it would be ingratitude not to
notice; but what triumphs or matters of exciting moment can
reasonably be hoped for in the short existence of one who has
merely been a writer for the press? After death has stilled the
pulses of a generous man such as Mr. Kelly was, it is with small
anticipation of rendering a satisfactory return, that any one can
undertake to sketch the principal events of his life.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, a matter for felicitation that Mr. Kelly has been
his own autobiographer. His narratives and recitals are nearly
all personal. They are mostly the results of his own observation
and experience; and those who, in accordance with a practice we
fear now too little attended to, read the Preface before the body
of the work, will, we trust, understand that the stories in which
"Falconbridge" claims to have been an actor, are to be received
with as much confidence as truthful accounts, as if some Boswell
treasured them up with care, and minutely detailed them for the
admiration of those who should follow after him.</p>

<p>Jonathan F. Kelly was born in Philadelphia, on the 14th day of
August, A. D. 1817. Young Jonathan was, at the proper age,
placed at school, where he acquired the rudiments of a plain
English education, sufficient to enable him, with the practice and
experience to be gained in the world, to improve the advantages
derived from his tuition. He was, while yet a boy, placed for
a time in a grocery store, and subsequently was employed by
Lewis W. Glenn, a perfumer, whose place of business was then
in Third street above Walnut.</p>

<p>In 1837, Jonathan, being of the age of nineteen years, determined
to go out into the world to seek adventure and fortune.
He accordingly set out for that great region to which attention
was then turned&mdash;the Western country. Having but slight
means to pay the expenses of traveling, he walked nearly the
whole of the journey. At Chillicothe, in Ohio, his wanderings
were for a time ended. The exposure to which he had been subjected,
caused a very severe attack of pleurisy. It happened
most fortunately for him that a kind farmer, Mr. John A. Harris,
pitied the boy; whose sprightliness, social accomplishments, and
good conduct, had made a favorable impression. He was taken into
Mr. Harris' family, and assiduously nursed during an indisposition
which lasted more than two months. This circumstance
appeased his roving disposition for a time, and he remained upon
the farm of his good friend, Mr. Harris, for two years, making
himself practically acquainted with the life and toils of an agriculturist.
In 1839, he concluded to return to Philadelphia, where
he remained for a time with his family. But the spirit of adventure
returned. He connected himself with a theatrical company,
and traveling through Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, was
finally checked in his career at Pittsburg, where he undertook
the management of a hotel. This business not being congenial,
he soon sold out the establishment, and returned to Philadelphia.
He shortly afterwards started away on a theatrical tour, which
extended through most of the Southern States, and into Texas.
In this tour, Mr. Kelly went through a great variety of adventures,
saw many strange scenes, and obtained a fund of amusing
experience, which afterward served him to great advantage in
his literary sketches. After having thoroughly exhausted his
roving desires, he returned to Philadelphia, where, indeed, upon
his previous visit, he had become subject to a new attraction,
the most powerful which could be found to restrain his wandering
impulses. He had become acquainted with a worthy young lady,
to whom, upon his return, and in the year 1842, he was married.</p>

<p>This union changed the thoughts and objects of Mr. Kelly.
His wild, bachelor life was over; and he seriously considered how
it was possible for him who had been educated to no regular business,
to find the means of support for himself and family. Believing
himself to have some literary capacity, he was induced to go to
Pittsburg, in order to commence a newspaper in partnership with
U. J. Jones. This enterprise was not a successful one, and with
his companion he went to Cincinnati, where he enlisted in another
newspaper speculation. The result of that attempt was equally
unpropitious. Dissolving their interests, Mr. Kelly then removed
with his family to New York. Here he commenced a journal devoted
to theatrical and musical criticism, and intelligence, entitled
"The Archer." Mr. J. W. Taylor was a partner with him in the
publication. The twain also engaged in the fancy business, having
a store in Broadway, above Grand street. The adventure there
not being very successful, the partnership in that branch of their
concern was dissolved, and Mr. Kelly commenced a book and
periodical store nearly opposite. This was about the year 1844.
"The Archer" was soon after discontinued, and Mr. K. returned
to Philadelphia. About this time he commenced writing contributions
for various newspapers, under the signature of "Falconbridge."
His essays in this line, which were published in the
"New York Spirit of the Times," were received with much favor,
and widely copied by the press throughout the country. The
reputation thus attained, was such that he found himself in a
fair way to make a lucrative and pleasant livelihood. His
sketches were in demand, and were readily sold, whilst the prices
were remunerative, and enabled him to attain a degree of domestic
comfort which he had before that time not known. From
Philadelphia he removed to Boston, where he hoped to find permanent
employment as an editor. During six months he relied
upon the sale of his sketches, and again returned to New York,
from which he was recalled by an advantageous offer from
Paige &amp; Davis, if he would undertake the control of "The Bostonian."
He filled the editorial chair of that paper for two years,
when it was discontinued. He had now plenty to do, and was
constantly engaged upon sketches for the "Yankee Blade,"
"The N. Y. Spirit of the Times," and many other journals and
magazines, adopting the signatures, "Falconbridge," "Jack Humphries,"
"O. K.," "Cerro Gordo," "J. F. K.," etc. During this
time he projected "The Aurora Borealis," which was published
in Boston. It was really one of the most handsome and humorous
journals ever commenced in the United States, but it was
very expensive. After some months' trial, "The Aurora Borealis"
was abandoned. Mr. Kelly remained in Boston as a general
literary contributor to various journals until, in 1851, he was induced
to undertake the management of a paper at Waltham,
Mass., entitled "The Waltham Advocate." This enterprise,
after six months trial, did not offer sufficient inducements to
continue it, and Mr. Kelly returned with his family to Boston.
Whilst in that city, he had the misfortune to lose his eldest son,
a fine promising boy about five years and four months old; he
died after a sickness of between two and three days. Mr. Kelly
was a kind and excellent husband, and affectionate father. He
doted on his child; and the loss so preyed upon his spirits, that
it produced a brooding melancholy, which he predicted would
eventually cause his death. After this time, General Samuel
Houston, of Texas, made him very advantageous and liberal offers
if he would establish himself in that State. He left Boston for
the purpose, but was detained in Philadelphia by the sickness of
another favorite child. Whilst thus delayed, a proposal was
made him to undertake the editorship of "The New York Dutchman."
He remained in that position about four months, when
still more advantageous offers were tendered him to conduct "The
Great West," published at Cincinnati. In September, 1854, he
reached that city, and entered upon his duties. He continued in
the discharge of them about four months. In the meanwhile, he
had become associated with the American party; and induced by
those promises which politicians make freely, and perform rarely,
he left the journal to which he was attached, to establish a paper
entitled "The American Platform." But two numbers of this
effort were published. Whilst his writings were lively and flowing,
he was sick at heart. The loss of his son still weighed on his
mind, and he was an easy prey to pestilence. He was attacked
by Asiatic cholera; and died on the 21st of July, 1855, after
twenty-four hours' illness, leaving a widow and three children to
mourn his early death. His remains were deposited in Spring
Grove Cemetery. There rests beneath the soil of that beautiful
garden of the dead, no form whose impulses in life were more
honest, generous, and noble, than those which guided the actions
of Jonathan F. Kelly.</p>

<p>The writer of this short biography, who only knew Mr. Kelly by
his literary works, and whose narrative has been made up from the
information of friends, feels that he would scarcely discharge the
duty he has assumed, without a few words of reflection upon the
fitful career so slightly traced. For the useful purpose of life, it
may well be doubted whether a dull, plodding disposition is not
more certain of success, than lively, impulsive genius. Perseverance
in any one calling, with a steady determination to turn
aside for no collateral inducements, and a patience which does not
become discouraged at the first disappointment, is necessary to
the ultimate prosperity of every man. The newspaper business
is one which particularly requires constant application, a determination
to do the best in the present, and a firm reliance upon
success in the future. There is scarcely a journal or newspaper
in the United States, which has succeeded without passing through
severe ordeals, whilst the slow public were determining whether
it should be patronized, or waiting to discover whether it is likely
to become permanently established. Mr. Kelly's wanderings in
early life seem to have tinctured his later career with the hue of
instability. Ever, it would seem, ready to enlist in any new enterprise,
he was led to abandon those occupations, which, if persevered
in, would probably have been triumphant. His life was a
constant series of changes, in which ill-luck seems to have continually
triumphed, because ill-luck was not sufficiently striven with.
In all these mutations, it will be the solace of those who knew and
loved him, that however his judgment may have led him astray
from worldly advantage, his heart was always constant to his
family. Affectionate and generous in disposition, he was true to
them; and he persevered in laboring for them under every disadvantage.
Altering his position&mdash;at times an editor&mdash;at times an
assistant-editor&mdash;anon changing his business as new hopes were
roused in his bosom&mdash;and then being a mere writer, depending
upon the sale of his fugitive sketches for the means of support&mdash;in
all these experiments with Fortune, he was ever true to the
fond spirit which gently ruled at home. For the great purposes,
and high moral lessons of existence, a faithful, constant heart
has a wealth richer and more bountiful than can be bought with gold.</p>

<h2><a name="in_the_Morning" id="in_the_Morning"></a>If it ain't right, I'll make it all right in the Morning!</h2>


<p>A keen, genteely dressed, gentlemanly man "put up" at
Beltzhoover's Hotel, in Baltimore, one day some years
ago, and after dining very sumptuously every day, drinking his
Otard, Margieux and Heidsic, and smoking his "Tras,"
"Byrons," and "Cassadoras," until the landlord began to
surmise the "bill" getting voluminous, he made the clerk
foot it up and present it to our modern Don Cæsar De Bazan,
who, casting his eye over the long lines of perpendicularly
arranged figures, discovered that&mdash;which in no wise
alarmed him, however&mdash;he was in for a matter of a cool C!</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, I see; <i>well</i>, I presume it's all right, all correct,
sir, no doubt about it," says Don Cæsar.</p>

<p>"No doubt at all, sir," says the polite clerk,&mdash;"we
seldom present a bill, sir, until the gentlemen are about to
leave, sir; but when the bills are unusually large, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Large, sir? Large, my dear fellow"&mdash;says the Don&mdash;"bless
your soul, you don't call <i>that</i> large? Why, sir, a&mdash;a&mdash;that
is, when I was in Washington, at Gadsby's, sir,
bless you, I frequently had my friends of the Senate and
the Ministers to dine at my rooms, and what do you suppose
my bills averaged a week, there, sir?"</p>

<p>"I can't possibly say, sir&mdash;must have counted up very
<i>heavy</i>, sir, I think," responds the clerk.</p>

<p>"Heavy! ha! ha! you may well say they were <i>heavy</i>,
my dear fellow&mdash;<i>five and eight hundred dollars a week!</i>"
says the Don, with a nonchalance that would win the admiration
of a flash prince of the realm.</p>

<p>"O, no doubt of it, sir; it is very expensive to keep
company, and entertain the government officers, at Washington,
sir," the clerk replies.</p>

<p>"You're right, my dear fellow; you're right. But let
me see," and here the Don stuck a little glass in the corner
of his eye, and glanced at the bill; "ah, yes, I see, $102.51&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;something&mdash;all
right, I presume; if it ain't right,
<i>we'll make it all right in the morning</i>."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir; that will answer, sir," says the clerk,
about to bow himself out of the room.</p>

<p>"One moment, if you please, my dear fellow; that Marteux
of yours is really superb. A friend dined here yesterday
with me&mdash;he is a&mdash;a gentleman who imports a&mdash;a great
deal of wine; he a&mdash;a&mdash;pronounces your Schreider an elegant
article. I shall entertain some friends to-night, here,
and do you see that we have sufficient of that 'Marteux'
and 'Schreider' cooling for us; my friends are judges of a
pure article, and a&mdash;a I wish them to have a&mdash;a good
opinion of your house. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, sir; that'll be all right," says the clerk.</p>

<p>"Of course; if it ain't, I'll make it all right in the morning!"
says the Don Cæsar, as the official vanished.</p>

<p>"Well, Charles, did you present that gentleman's bill?"
asks the host of the clerk, as they met at "the office."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he says it's all right, or he'll make it all right
in the morning, sir," replies the clerk.</p>

<p>"Very well," says the anxious host; "<i>see that he
does it</i>."</p>

<p>That evening a Captain Jones called on Don Cæsar&mdash;a
servant carried up the card&mdash;Captain Jones was requested
to walk up. Lieutenant Smith, U. S. N., next called&mdash;"walk
up." Dr. Brown called&mdash;"walk up." Col. Green,
his card&mdash;"walk up;" and so on, until some six or eight
distinguished persons were walked up to Don Cæsar's private
parlor; and pretty soon the silver necks were brought
up, corks were popping, glasses were clinking, jests and
laughter rose above the wine and cigars, and Don Cæsar
was putting his friends through in the most approved style!</p>

<p>Time flew, as it always does. Capt. Jones gave the
party a bit of a salt-water song, Dr. Brown pitched in a
sentiment, while Colonel Green and Lieutenant Smith
talked largely of the "last session," what <i>their</i> friend
Benton said to Webster, and Webster to Benton, and
what Bill Allen said to 'em both. And Miss Corsica, the
French Minister's daughter, what she had privately intimated
to Lieutenant Smith in regard to American ladies,
and what the Hon. so and so offered to do and say for
Colonel Green, and so and so and so and so. Still the
corks "popped," and the glasses jingled, and the merry
jest, and the laugh jocund, and the rich sentiment, and
richer fumes of the cigars filled the room.</p>

<p>Don Cæsar kept on hurrying up the wine, and as each
bottle was uncorked, he assured the servants&mdash;"All right;
if it ain't all right, <i>we'll make it all right in the morning!</i>"</p>

<p>And so Don Cæsar and his <i>bon vivant</i> friends went it,
until some two dozen bottles of Schreider, Hock, and
Sherry had decanted, and the whole entire party were getting
as merry as grigs, and so noisy and rip-roarious,
that the clerk of the institution came up, and standing
outside of the door, sent a servant to Don Cæsar, to politely
request that gentleman to step out into the hall one moment.</p>

<p>"What's that?" says the Don; "speak loud, I've got a
buzzing in my ears, and can't hear whispers."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tompkins, sir, the clerk of the house, sir," replies
the servant, in a sharp key.</p>

<p>"Well, what the deuce of Tompkins&mdash;hic&mdash;what does
he&mdash;hic&mdash;does he want? Tell&mdash;hic&mdash;tell him it's&mdash;hic&mdash;all
right, or we'll make it all right&mdash;hic&mdash;<i>in the morning</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Tompkins then took the liberty of stepping inside,
and slipping up to Don Cæsar, assured him that himself
and friends were <i>a little too merry</i>, but Don Cæsar assured Tompkins&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's all&mdash;hic&mdash;right, mi boy, all&mdash;hic&mdash;right; these gentlemen&mdash;hic&mdash;are
all <i>gentlemen</i>, my&mdash;hic&mdash;personal friends&mdash;hic&mdash;and
it's all right&mdash;hic&mdash;all perfectly&mdash;hic&mdash;right, or
we'll make it all right in the morning."</p>

<p>"That we do not question, sir," says the clerk, "but
there are many persons in the adjoining rooms whom you'll
disturb, sir; I speak for the credit of the house."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;hic&mdash;certainly, certainly, mi boy; I'll&mdash;hic&mdash;I'll
speak to the gentlemen," says the Don, rising in his chair,
and assuming a very solemn graveness, peculiar to men in
the fifth stage of libation deep; "Gentlemen&mdash;hic&mdash;<i>gentle</i>men,
I'm requested to state&mdash;hic&mdash;that&mdash;hic&mdash;a very <i>serious</i>
piece of intelligence&mdash;hic&mdash;has met my ear. This <i>gentle</i>man&mdash;hic&mdash;says
somebody's dead in the next&mdash;hic&mdash;room."</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir; I did not say that, sir," says the clerk.</p>

<p>"Beg&mdash;hic&mdash;your pardon, sir&mdash;hic&mdash;it's all right; if it
ain't all right, I'll make it&mdash;hic&mdash;<i>all right in the morning!</i>
Gentlemen, let's&mdash;hic&mdash;us all adjourn; let's change the see&mdash;hic&mdash;scene,
call a coach&mdash;hic&mdash;somebody, let's take a ride&mdash;hic&mdash;and
return and go to&mdash;hic&mdash;our pious&mdash;hic&mdash;rest."</p>

<p>Having delivered this order and exhortation, Don Cæsar
arose on his pins, and marshalling his party, after a general
swap of hats all around, in which trade big heads got
smallest hats, and small heads got largest hats, by aid of
the staircase and the servants, they all got to the street, and
lumbering into a large hack, they started off on a midnight
airing, noisy and rip-roarious as so many sailors on a land
cruise. The last words uttered by Don Cæsar, there, as
the coach drove off, were:</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;hic&mdash;mi boy, if it ain't, <i>we'll make it all
right in the morning!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, that we will," says the landlord, "and if I don't
stick you into a bill of costs '<i>in the morning</i>,' rot me.
You'll have a nice time," he continued, "out carousing
till daylight; lucky I've got his wallet in the fire-proof,
the jackass would be robbed before he got back,
<i>and I'd lose my bill!</i>"</p>

<p>Don Cæsar did not return to make good his promise <i>in
the morning</i>, and so the landlord took the liberty of investigating
the wallet, deposited for safe keeping in the fire-proof
of the office, by the Don; and lo! and behold! it
contained old checks, unreceipted bills, and a few samples
of Brandon bank notes, with this emphatic remark:&mdash;"All
right, if it ain't all right, <span class="smcap">we'll make it all right in the morning</span>!"</p>

<p>We are astounded at the incredulity of some people.
Every now and then you run afoul of somebody who does
not believe in spiritual knockers. Enter any of our drinking
saloons, take a seat, or stand up, and look on for an
hour or two, especially about the time "churchyards yawn!"

<h2><a name="Old_Black_Bull" id="Old_Black_Bull"></a>The Old Black Bull</h2>


<p>It's poor human natur', all out, to wrangle and quarrel
now and then, from the kitchen to the parlor, in church
and state. Even the fathers of the holy tabernacle are not
proof against this little weakness; for people will have
passions, people will belong to meetin', and people will
let their passions <i>rise</i>, even under the pulpit. But we have
no distinct recollection of ever having known a misdirected,
but properly interpreted <i>letter</i>, to settle a chuckly
"plug muss," so efficiently and happily as the case we have
in point.</p>

<p>Old John Bulkley (grandson of the once famous President
<i>Chauncey</i>) was a minister of the gospel, and one of
the best <i>edicated</i> men of his day in the wooden nutmeg
State, when the immortal (or ought to be) Jonathan Trumbull
was "around," and in his youth. Mr. Bulkley was the
first <i>settled</i> minister in the town of his adoption, Colchester,
Connecticut. It was with him, as afterwards with good
old brother Jonathan (Governor Trumbull, the bosom
friend of General Washington), good to confer on almost
any matter, scientific, political, or religious&mdash;any subject,
in short, wherein common sense and general good to all concerned
was the issue. As a philosophical reasoner, casuist,
and <i>good</i> counselor, he was "looked up to," and abided by.</p>

<p>It so fell out that a congregation in Mr. Bulkley's
vicinity got to loggerheads, and were upon the apex of
raising "the evil one" instead of a spire to their church, as
they proposed and <i>split</i> upon. The very nearest they could
come to a mutual cessation of the hostilities, was to appoint
a <i>committee</i> of three, to wait on Mr. Bulkley, state
their <i>case</i>, and get him to adjudicate. They waited on the
old gentleman, and he listened with grave attention to their
conflicting grievances.</p>

<p>"It appears to me," said the old gentleman, "that this
is a very simple case&mdash;a very trifling thing to cause you so
much vexation."</p>

<p>"So I say," says one of the <i>committee</i>.</p>

<p>"I don't call it a trifling case, Mr. Bulkley," said another.</p>

<p>"No case at all," responded the third.</p>

<p>"It ain't, eh?" fiercely answered the first speaker.</p>

<p>"No, it ain't, sir!" quite as savagely replied the third.</p>

<p>"It's anything but a trifling case, anyhow," echoed
number two, "to expect to raise the minister's salary and
that new steeple, too, out of our small congregation."</p>

<p>"There is no danger of raising much out of <i>you</i>, anyhow,
Mr. Johnson," spitefully returned number one.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, if you please&mdash;" beseechingly interposed the sage.</p>

<p>"I haven't come here, Mr. Bulkley, to quarrel," said one.</p>

<p>"Who started this?" sarcastically answered Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>"Not me, anyway," number three replies.</p>

<p>"You don't say I did, do you?" says number one.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!&mdash;gentlemen!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bulkley, you see how it is; there's Johnson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Bulkley," says Johnson, "and there's old
Winkles, too, and here's Deacon Potter, also."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> here," stiffly replied the deacon, "and I am sorry
the Reverend Mr. Bulkley finds me in such company, sir!"</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, <i>brothers</i>, if you please," said Mr.
Bulkley, "this is ridiculous,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I say," murmured Mr. Winkles.</p>

<p>"As far as <i>you</i> are concerned, it is ridiculous," said the deacon.</p>

<p>This brought Mr. Winkles <i>up</i>, standing.</p>

<p>"Sir!" he shouted, "sir!"</p>

<p>"But my dear <i>sirs</i>&mdash;" beseechingly said the philosopher.</p>

<p>"Sir!" continued Winkles, "sir! I am too old a man&mdash;too
good a Christian, Mr. Bulkley, to allow a man, a mean,
despicable <i>toad</i>, like Deacon Potter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you call me&mdash;<i>me</i> a despicable <i>toad</i>?" menacingly
cried the deacon.</p>

<p>"Brethren," said Mr. Bulkley, "if I am to counsel you
in your difference, I must have no more of this unchristian-like bickering."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to bicker, sir," said Johnson.</p>

<p>"Nor I don't want to, sir," said the deacon, "but when
a man calls me a toad, a mean, despicable <i>toad</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, never mind," said Mr. Bulkley; "you are
all too excited now; go home again, and wait patiently;
on Saturday evening next, I will have prepared and sent to
you a written opinion of your case, with a full and free
avowal of most wholesome advice for preserving your church
from desolation and yourselves from despair." And the
committee left, to await his issue.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Mr. Bulkley had a small farm, some
distance from the town of Colchester, and found it necessary,
the same day he wrote his opinion and advice to the
brethren of the disaffected church, to drop a line to his
farmer regarding the fixtures of said estate. Having
written a long, and of course, elaborate "essay" to his
brethren, he wound up the day's literary exertions with a
despatch to the farmer, and after a reverie to himself,
he directs the two documents, and next morning despatches
them to their several destinations.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening a full and anxious synod of the
belligerent churchmen took place in their tabernacle, and
punctually, as promised, came the despatch from the Plato
of the time and place,&mdash;Rev. John Bulkley. All was quiet
and respectful attention. The moderator took up the document,
broke the seal, opened and&mdash;a pause ensued, while
dubious amazement seemed to spread over the features of
the worthy president of the meeting.</p>

<p>"Well, brother Temple, how is it&mdash;what does Mr. Bulkley
say?" and another pause followed.</p>

<p>"Will the moderator please proceed?" said another voice.</p>

<p>The moderator placed the paper upon the table, took off
his spectacles, wiped the glasses, then his lips&mdash;replaced his
specs upon his nose, and with a very broad <i>grin</i>, said:</p>

<p>"Brethren, this appears to me to be a very singular letter,
to say the least of it!"</p>

<p>"Well, read it&mdash;read it," responded the wondering hearers.</p>

<p>"I will," and the moderator began:</p>

<p>"You will see to the repair of the fences, that they be
built high and strong, and you will take special care <i>of
the old Black Bull</i>."</p>

<p>There was a general pause; a silent mystery overspread
the community; the moderator dropped the paper to a
"rest," and gazing over the top of his glasses for several
minutes, nobody saying a word.</p>

<p>"Repair the fences!" muttered the moderator at length.</p>

<p>"Build them strong and high!" echoed Deacon Potter.</p>

<p>"Take special care <i>of the old Black Bull!</i>" growled half
the meeting.</p>

<p>Then another pause ensued, and each man eyed his neighbor
in mute mystery.</p>

<p>A tall and venerable man now arose from his seat; clearing
his voice with a hem, he spoke:</p>

<p>"Brethren, you seem lost in the brief and eloquent
words of our learned adviser. To me nothing could be
more appropriate to our case. It is just such a profound
and applicable reply to us as we should have hoped and
looked for, from the learned and good man, John Bulkley.
The direction to repair the fences, is to take heed in the
admission and government of our members; we must guard
the church by our Master's laws, and keep out stray and
vicious cattle from the fold! And, above all things, set a
trustworthy and vigilant watch over that old black bull,
who is the devil, and who has already broken into our enclosures
and sought to desolate and lay waste the fair
grounds of our church!"</p>

<p>The effect of this interpretation was electrical. All saw
and <i>took</i> the force of Mr. Bulkley's cogent advice, and
unanimously resolved to be governed by it; hence the old
black bull was put <i>hors du combat</i>, and the church preserved its union!</p>

<p>Dobbs walked into a <i>Dry Goodery</i>, on Court street, and
began to look around. A double <i>jinted</i> clerk immediately
appeared to Dobbs.</p>

<p>"What can I <i>do</i> for you, sir?" says he.</p>

<p>"A good deal," says Dobbs, "but I bet you won't."</p>

<p>"I'll bet I will," says the knight of the yard-stick, "if I <i>can</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="Used_Up" id="Used_Up"></a>Used Up.</h2>


<p>I am tempted to believe, that few&mdash;very few men can start
in the world&mdash;say at twenty, with a replete invoice of
honesty, free and easy&mdash;kind, generous&mdash;good-natured disposition,
and keep it up, until they greet their fortieth
year. There are, doubtless, plenty of men&mdash;I hope there
are, who <i>would</i> be entirely and perfectly generous-hearted,
if they <i>could</i>, with any degree of consistency; and I know
there are multitudes who wouldn't exhibit an honorable or
manly trait, of any human description, if they could.
That class thrive best, it appears to me&mdash;if the accumulation
of dollars and dimes be Webster, Walker, or Scriptural
interpretation of that sense&mdash;in this sublunary world.
Meanness and dishonesty win what good nature and honesty
lose, hence the more thrift to the former, and the less gain,
pecuniarily considered, to the latter. The subject is very
prolific, and as my present purpose is as much to point a
humorous <i>sketch</i> as to adorn a <i>moral</i>, I needs must cut
speculative philosophistics for facts, in the case of my friend
John Jenks, an emphatic&mdash;"used up" good fellow.</p>

<p>Jenks started in this world with a first-rate opinion of
himself and the rest of mankind. No man ever started
with a larger capital of good nature, human benevolence,
and common honesty, than honest John. Few men ever
started with better general prospects, for "a good time,"
and plenty of it, than Jenks. He <i>graduated</i> with honor to
himself and the Institute of his native State, and with but
little knowledge beyond the college library and the social
circles of his immediate friends. At twenty-three, John
Jenks went into business on his own hook.</p>

<p>Of course John soon formed various and many business
acquaintances; he learned that men were brothers&mdash;should
love, honor, and respect one another, from precepts set him
at his father's fireside. He formed the opinion, that this
brotherhood was not to be alienated in matters of business,
for he never refused to act kindly to all; he freely loaned
his <i>autograph</i> and purse to his business acquaintances; but,
being backed up by a snug business capital, he seldom felt
the necessity of claiming like accommodation, or he would
have gotten his eye teeth cut cheaper and sooner.</p>

<p>"Jenks," said a business man, stopping in at Jenks' counting
room one September morning, "Perkins &amp; Ball, I see,
have <i>stopped</i>&mdash;gone to smash!"</p>

<p>"Have they?" quickly responded Jenks.</p>

<p>"They have, and a good many fingers will be burnt by
them," replied the informant. "By the way, Barclay says
you have some of their <i>paper</i> on hand; is it true?" continued
the man.</p>

<p>"I have some, not much," answered Jenks&mdash;"not enough
at all events to create any alarm as to their willingness or
ability to take it up."</p>

<p>But in looking over his "accounts," Jenks found a considerably
larger amount of Perkins &amp; Ball's <i>paper</i> on
hand, than an experienced business man might have contemplated
with entire Christian resignation. The gazette,
in the course of a few days, gave publicity to the <i>smash</i>
of the house of Perkins, Ball &amp; Co. There was a buzz
"on 'change;" those losers by the <i>smash</i> were bitter in
their denunciatory remarks, while those gaining by the transaction
snickered in their sleeves and kept mum. Jenks
heard all, and said nothing. He reasoned, that if the firm
were <i>smashed</i> by imprudences, or through dishonest motives,
they were getting "an elegant sufficiency" of public and
private vituperation, without his aid. Though far from his
thoughts of entering into such "lists," and inclined to hold
on and see how things come out&mdash;Jenks, for the credit of
common humanity, seldom recapitulated the amount, by
discounting, &amp;c.&mdash;he was likely to be <i>in</i> for, if P. &amp; B.
were really "done gone." This resolve, like some <i>rules</i>,
worked both ways.</p>

<p>As "honest John" was drawing on his gloves to leave
his commercial institution, after the above occurrences had
had some ten days' <i>grace</i>; one evening, the senior partner
of the house of Perkins &amp; Ball came in. Greetings were
cordial, and in the private office of Jenks, an hour's discourse
took place between the merchants; which, in brief
transcription, may be summed up in the fact, that Jenks
received a two-third indemnification on all <i>his</i> liabilities <i>for</i>
the <i>smashed</i> house of P. &amp; B., which the senior partner assured
him, arose from the fact of his, Jenks', gentlemanly
forbearance in not joining the clamor against them, in the
adverse hour, nor pushing his claims, when he had reason
to believe that they were down; quite down at the heel.
Jenks "hoped" he should never be found on the wrong or
even doubtful side of humanity, gentlemanly courtesy, or
Christian kindness; they shook hands and parted; the
senior partner of the exploded firm requesting, and Jenks
agreeing, to say every thing he could towards sustaining the
honor of the house of P. &amp; B., and recreating its now
almost extinguished credit. Those who fought the bankrupt
merchants most got the least, and because Jenks preserved
an undisturbed serenity, when it was known that he
was as deeply a loser, they supposed, as any one, they were
staggered at his philosophy, or amused at his extreme good
nature. This latter result seemed the most popular and
accepted notion of Jenks' character, and proved the ground-work
of his pecuniary destruction.</p>

<p>The firm of Perkins &amp; Ball crept up again; Jenks had,
on all occasions, spoken in the most favorable terms of the
firm; he not only freely endorsed again for them, but stood
their <i>referee</i> generally. In the meantime, Jenks' celebrity
for good nature and open-heartedness had drawn around
him a host of patrons and admirers. Jenks' name became
a circulating medium for half his business acquaintances.
If Brown was short in his cash account, five hundred or a
thousand dollars&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just run over to Jenks'," he'd say to his clerk; "ask
him to favor me with a check until the middle of the week."
It was done.</p>

<p>"Terms&mdash;thirty days with good endorsed paper," was
sufficient for the adventurous Smith to <i>buy</i> and depend on
Jenks' <i>autograph</i> to <i>secure</i> the goods. When in funds,
Bingle went where he chose; when a little <i>short</i>, Jenks had
his patronage. Jenks kept but few memorandums of acts
of kindness he daily committed; hence when the evil effects
of them began to revolve upon him&mdash;if not mortified or
ashamed of his "bargains," he at least was astounded at
the results. Brown, whose due bills or memorandums
Jenks held, to the amount of seven thousand dollars, accommodation
<i>loans</i>, took an apoplectic, one warm summer's
day, after taking a luxurious dinner. Jenks had hardly
learned that Brown's affairs were pronounced in a state of
deferred bankruptcy, when the first rumor reached him that
Smith had <i>bolted</i>, after a heavy transaction in "woolens"&mdash;Jenks
his principal endorser&mdash;Smith not leaving assets or
assigns to the amount of one red farthing.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" poor Jenks muttered, as he tremulously
seated himself in his back counting room&mdash;"that's shabby in
Smith&mdash;very shabby."</p>

<p>The next morning's Gazette informed the community
that Bingle had failed&mdash;liabilities over $200,000&mdash;prospects
barely giving hopes of ten per cent, all around; and even
this hope, upon Jenks' investigation, proved a forlorn one;
by a <i>modus operandi</i> peculiar to the heartless, self-devoted,
<i>they</i> got all, Jenks and the <i>few</i> of his ilk, got nothing!</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Jenks became pecuniarily
moody. For the first time, in the course of his mercantile
career, of some six years, the force of reflection convinced
him, that he had not acted his part judiciously, however
"well done" it might be, in point of honor and manliness.</p>

<p>The next day Jenks devoted to a scrutiny of his accounts
in general with the business world. He found things a
great deal "mixed up;" his balance-sheet exhibited large
surplusages accumulated on the score of his leniency and
good nature; by the credit of those with whom he held
business relations. A council of war, or expediency,
rather,&mdash;<i>solus</i>, convinced Jenks, he had either mistaken his
business qualifications, or formed a very vague idea of the
soul&mdash;manners and customs of the business world; and
he broke up his council, a sadder if not a wiser man.</p>

<p>"By Jove, this is discouraging; I'll have to do a very
disagreeable thing, very disagreeable thing: <i>make an assignment!</i>"</p>

<p>"Who'd thought John Jenks would ever come to that?"
that individual muttered to himself, as he proceeded to his
hotel. And ere he reached his plate, at the tea-table, a
servant whispered that a gentleman with a message was
out in the "office" of the hotel, anxious to see Mr. Jenks.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jenks&mdash;John Jenks, I believe, sir?" began the
person, as poor Jenks, now on the <i>tapis</i> for more ill news,
approached the person in waiting.</p>

<p>"Precisely, that's my name, sir," Jenks responded.</p>

<p>"Then," continued the stranger, "I've disagreeable
business with you, Mr. Jenks; <i>I hold your arrest!</i>"</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Jenks; "my arrest? What for?"</p>

<p>"There's the writ, sir; you can read it."</p>

<p>"A <i>writ</i>? Why, God bless you, man, I don't <i>owe</i> a
dollar in the world, but what I can liquidate in ten minutes!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not debt, sir; you may see by the writ it's <i>felony!</i>"</p>

<p>If the man had drawn and cocked a revolver at Jenks, the
effect upon his nervous system could not have been more startling
or powerful. But he recovered his self-possession, and
learned with dismay, that he was arrested&mdash;yes, <i>arrested</i> as
an accessory to a grand scheme of fraud and general villany,
on the part of Smith, a conclusion arrived at, by
those most interested, upon discovery that Jenks had pronounced
Smith "good," and endorsed for him in sums
total, enormously, far beyond Jenks' actual ability to make good!</p>

<p>It was in vain Jenks declared, and no man before ever
dreamed of doubting his word, his entire ability to meet all
liabilities of his own and others, for whom he kindly become
responsible; for when the <i>bulk</i> of Smith's <i>paper</i> with Jenks'
endorsement was thrust at him, he gave in; saw clearly that
he was the victim of a heartless <i>forger</i>.</p>

<p>But his calmness, in the midst of his affliction, triumphed,
and he rested comparatively easy in jail that night, awaiting
the bright future of to-morrow, when his established
character, and "troops of friends" should set all right.
But, poor Jenks, he reckoned indeed without his host; to-morrow
came, but not "a friend in need;" they saw, in their
far-reaching wisdom, a sinking ship, and like sagacious rats,
they deserted it!</p>

<p>"I always thought Jenks a very good-natured, or a very
<i>deep</i> man," said one.</p>

<p>"I knew he was too generous to last long!" said another.</p>

<p>"I told him he was <i>green</i> to endorse as freely as he did,"
echoed a third.</p>

<p>"Good fellow," chimed a fourth&mdash;"but devilish imprudent."</p>

<p>"He knows what he's at!" cunningly retorted a fifth, and
so the good but misguided Jenks was disposed of by his
"troops of friends!"</p>

<p>But Perkins &amp; Ball&mdash;they had got up again, were flourishing;
they, Jenks felt satisfied, would not show the
"white feather," and the thought came to him, in his
prison, as <i>merrily</i> as the reverse of that fond hope made
him <i>sad</i> and sorrowful, when at the close of day, his attorney
informed him, that Perkins &amp; Ball regretted his perplexing
situation, but proffered him no aid or comfort.
They said, sad experience had shown them, that there were
no "bowels of compassion" in the world for the fallen;
men must trust to fortune, God, and their own exertions, to
defeat ill luck and rise from difficulties; <i>they</i> had done so;
Mr. Jenks must not despair, but surmount his misfortunes
with a stout heart and a clear conscience, and profit, as
they had, <i>by reverses!</i></p>

<p>"Profit!" said Jenks, in a bitter tone, "<i>profit</i> by reverses
as <i>they</i> have!"</p>

<p>"Why, Powers," he continued to his counsel, "do you
know that if I had been a tithe part as base and conscienceless
as they are <i>now</i>, Perkins &amp; Ball would be beggars,
if not inmates of this prison! Yes, sir, my casting
vote, of all the rest, would have done it. But no matter; I
had hoped to find, in a community where I had been useful,
generous and just, friends enough for all practical purposes,
without carrying my business difficulties to the fireside of
my parents and other relations. But that I must do now;
if, <i>if they fail me, then&mdash;&mdash; I cave!</i>"</p>

<p>Two days after that conference of the lawyer and the
merchant, "honest John" learned, with sorrow, that his
father was dead; estate involved, and his friends at home
in no favorable mood in reference to what they heard of
John Jenks and his "bad management" in the city.</p>

<p>John Jenks&mdash;heard no more&mdash;he "caved!" as he agreed to.</p>

<p>We pass over Jenks' <i>Smithsonian</i> difficulty, which a prudent
lawyer and discerning jury brought out all right.</p>

<p>We come to 1850&mdash;some fifteen or eighteen years after
John Jenks "caved." The John Jenks of 183- had been
ruined by his good nature, set adrift moneyless, in a manner,
with even a spotted reputation to begin with; he "profited
by his reverses," he was now a man of family&mdash;fifty,
fat, and wealthy, and altogether the meanest and most selfish
man you ever saw!</p>

<p>Jenks freely admits his originality is entirely&mdash;"<i>used
up!</i>" The reader may affix the <i>moral</i> of my sketch&mdash;at leisure.</p>

<h2><a name="Greatest_Moral_Engine" id="Greatest_Moral_Engine"></a>The Greatest Moral Engine.</h2>


<p>Say what you will, it's no use talking, poverty is more
potent and powerful, as a moral engine, than all the "sermons
and soda water," law, logic, and prison discipline,
ever started. All a man wants, while he <i>has</i> a chance to be
honest, and to get along smoothly, is a good situation and
two dollars a day; give him five dollars a day, and he gets
lazy and careless; while at ten, or a hundred a day, he
is sure to cultivate beastly feeling, eat and sleep to stupefaction,
become a <i>roue</i>, or a rotten politician. A poor
man, in misery, applies to God for consolation, while a rich
man applies to his banker, and tries on a "bender," or goes
on a tour to Europe, and studies foreign folly and French
license. Poverty is great; in a Christian community, or a
thriving village, it is equal to "martial law," in suppressing
moral rebellion and keeping down the "dander!" And
how faithful, too, is poverty, says Dr. Litterage, for it
sticks to a man after all his friends and the rest of mankind
have deserted him!</p>

<h2><a name="of_Capt_Paul" id="of_Capt_Paul"></a>The Story of Capt. Paul.</h2>


<p>I love to speak, I love to write of the mighty West. I
have passed ten happy and partly pleasant years travelling
over the immense tracts of land of the West and South. I
have, during that time, garnered up endless themes for my
pen. It was my custom, during my travels, to keep a
"log," as the mariners have it, and at the close of the day I
always noted the occurrences that transpired with me or
others, when of interest, and opportunities were favorable
to do so.</p>

<p>Several years ago I was stopping at Vevay, Indiana, a
small village on the Ohio river, waiting for a steamboat to
touch there and take me up to Louisville, Ky. It was in
the fall of the year, water was very low, and but few boats
running. Shortly after breakfast, I took my rifle and ammunition
and started down along the river to amuse myself,
and kill time by hunting. Game was scarce, and after
strolling along until noon, I got tired and came out to the
river to see if any boats were in sight, as well as take shelter
from a heavy shower of rain that had come on. I sought
an immense old tree, whose broad crown and thick foliage
made my shelter as dry as though under a roof, and here I
sat down, bending my eyes along the placid, quiet and
noble river, until I was quite lost in silent reverie. The
rain poured down, and presently I heard a footstep approaching
from the woods behind, and at the same moment
a rough, curly dog came smelling along towards me. The
dog came up to within a few rods of me and stopped,
took a grin at me and then disappeared again. But my
further anxiety was soon relieved by the appearance of a
tall, gaunt man, dressed in the usual costume of a western
woodsman, jean trowsers, hunting shirt, old slouched felt
hat, rifle, powder horn, bullet pouch, and sheath knife. He
was an old man, face sallow and wrinkled, and hair quite
a steelish hue.</p>

<p>"Mornin', stranger," said he; "rayther a wet day for game?"</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative, and welcomed him to my
shelter. Having taken a seat near me, on the fallen trunk
of a small tree, the old man, half to himself and partly to
me, sighed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, yes, <i>our</i> day is fast gwoin over; an entire
new set of folks will soon people this country, and the old
settler will be all gone, and no more thought of."</p>

<p>"I imagine," said I, interrupting his soliloquy, "that you
are an old settler, and have noted vast, wonderful changes
here in the Ohio Valley?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful; yes, yes, stranger, thar you're right; I
have seen wonderful changes since I first squatted 'yer,
thirty-five years ago. Every thing changes about one so,
that I skearse know the old river any more. 'Yer they've
brought their steamboats puffin', and blowin', and skeerin' off
the game, fish, and alligators. 'Yer they've built thar
towns and thar store houses, and thar nice farm houses,
and keep up sich a clatter and noise among 'em all, that
one fond of our old quiet times in the woods, goes nigh
bein' distracted with these new matters and folks."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "neighbor, you old woodsmen will have
to do as the Indians have done, and as Daniel Boone did,
when the advancing axe of civilization, and the mighty
steam and steel arms of enterprise and improvement make
the varmints leave their lairs, and the air heavy and clamorous
with the gigantic efforts of industry, genius, and
wealth, you must <i>fall back</i>. Our territories are boundless,
and there are yet dense forests, woods, and wilds, where
the Indian, lone hunter, and solitary beast, shall rove amid
the wild grandeur of God's infinite space for a century yet
to come."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, yes, young man; I should have long since up
stakes and rolled before this sweeping tide of new settlers,
only I can't bar to leave this tract 'yer; no, stranger, I can't
bar to do it."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," I replied; "one feels a strong love for
old homes, a lingering desire to lay one's bones to their final
resting place, near a spot and objects that life and familiarity
made dear."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, stranger, that's it, that's it. But look down
thar&mdash;thar's what makes this spot dear to me&mdash;thar, do you
see yon little hillock&mdash;yon little mound? Thar's what keeps
old Tom Ward 'yer for life."</p>

<p>The old man seemed deeply affected, and sighed heavily,
as he wiped the moisture from his eyes with the back of his
hand. I gazed down towards the spot he had called my
attention to, and there I beheld, indeed, something resembling
a solitary and lonely grave; wild flowers bloomed
around it, and a flat stone stood at the head, and a small
stake at the foot.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't often one comes this way to ask the question,
and the Lord knows, stranger, I'm always willing to tell
the sad story of that lonely grave. Well, well, it's no use
to grieve always, the red whelps have paid well for thar
doins, and now, but few of 'em are spared to repent&mdash;the
Lord forgive 'em all," to which I involuntarily echoed&mdash;"Amen!"</p>

<p>"Well, stranger, you see, about five-and-thirty years ago,
I left Western Virginia to come down 'yer in the Ohio
valley. I well remember the first glimpse I got of this
stream; it war a big stream to me, and I gloried in the
sight of it. Thar war but few settlements then upon its
banks, and thar war none of your roarin', splashin' steamboats
about; but I like the steamboats&mdash;thar grand creatures,
and go it like high-mettled horses. Well, I war a
young man then; me and my brother and our old mother
joined in with a neighbor, built a family boat, put in our
goods, and started off down the stream, towards the lower
part thar of Kentucky.</p>

<p>"Captain Paul, our neighbor, war an old woodsman,
though he war a young man; he had a wife and several fine,
growin' children along with us, and our journey for many
days war prosperous and pleasant. Capt. Paul's wife's sister
war along with us, a fine young creature she war too.
My brother and her I always carc'lated would make a
match of it when we reached our journey's end; but poor
Ben, God bless the boy, he little dreampt he'd be cut
off so soon in the prime of life, and leave his bones 'yer to
rot. I war young too, then, and little thought I should
ever come to be this old, withered-up creature you see me
now, stranger."</p>

<p>"Why, you appear to be a hearty, hale man yet," said I,
encouraging the old man to proceed in his narrative,
"and no doubt shoot as well and see as keenly and far as ever?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, I can drive a centre purty well yet; but my
hand begins to tremble sometimes, and I'm failing&mdash;yes,
yes, I know I'm failing. But, to go on with my story: I
acted as sort of pilot. Then the country were yet pretty full
of Ingins, and mighty few cabins war made along the river
in them times. The whites and red-skins war eternally
fighting. I won't say which war to blame; the whites killed
the creatures off fast enough, and the Ingins took plenty of
scalps and war cruel to the white man whenever they fastened on him.</p>

<p>"Our old ark or boat war well loaded down; a few loose
boards served as a shelter from the sun and rain, and a few
planks spiked to the sides 'bove water, kept the swells from
rollin' in on us. Two black boys helped the captain and I
to manage the boat, and an old black woman waited on the
wimin folks and did the cooking.</p>

<p>"You see yon pint thar, up the river?" continued the
narrator, pointing his long, bony finger towards a great
bend, and a point on the Kentucky side of the stream.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I see it distinctly."</p>

<p>"Well, it war thar, or jest above thar, about sunset of a
pleasant day, that we came drifting along with our flat-boat,
or <i>broad horn</i>, as they were called in them days,
when Captain Paul said he thought it would be a snug
place just behind the pint, to tie up to them same big
trees yet standin' thar as they did then. Ben, poor Ben
and I concluded too, it would be a clever place to camp for
the night; so we headed the boat in&mdash;for, you see, we
always kept in the middle of the stream, as near as possible,
to keep clear of the red skins who committed a mighty
heap of depredations upon the movers and river traders,
by decoyin' the boat on shore, or layin' in ambush and
firin' their rifles at the incautious folks in the boats that got
too nigh 'em. Guina and Joe, the two black boys, rowed
enough to get around the pint. We had no fear of the
Ingins, as we expected we war beyond thar haunts just
thar; mother war gettin' out the supper things, and Captain
Paul's wife and sister were nestling away the children.
Just then, as we got cleverly under the lee of the shore thar,
I heard a crack like a dry stick snappin' under foot&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Thar's a deer or bar,' said the captain.</p>

<p>"'Hold on your oars,' says I&mdash;'boys, I don't like that&mdash;it
'tain't a deer's tread, nor a bar's nether,' says I.</p>

<p>"By this time we had got within thirty yards of the bank&mdash;another
slight noise&mdash;the bushes moved, and I sung out&mdash;'Ingins,
by the Lord! back the boat, back, boys, back!'</p>

<p>"Poor Ben snatched up his rifle, so did the captain; but
before we could get way on the boat, a band of the bloody
devils rushed out and gave us a volley of shouts and
shower of balls, that made these hills and river banks echo
again. Poor Ben fell mortally wounded and bleeding, into
the bottom of the boat; two of the captain's children
were killed, his wife wounded, and a bullet dashed the cap
off my head.</p>

<p>"I shouted to the boys to pull, and soon got out of reach
of the Ingins. They had no canoes, bein' only a scoutin'
war party; they could not reach us. The wounded horses
and cows kicked and plunged among the goods, the wimin
and children screamed.</p>

<p>"Oh! stranger, it war a frightful hour; one I shall remember
to my dyin' day, as it war only yesterday I saw and
heard it. It war now dark, the boat half filled with water,
my brother dyin', Captain Paul nerveless hangin' over his
wife and children, cryin' like a whipped child. I still
clung on to my oar, and made the poor blacks pull for this
side of the river, as fast and well as thar bewildered and
frightened senses allowed 'em.</p>

<p>"My poor mother leaned over poor Ben. She held his
head in her lap; she opened his bosom and the blood flowed
out. He still breathed faintly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Benjamin, my son,' said she, 'do you know me?'</p>

<p>"'Mother,' he breathed lowly. Mother tried to have
him drink a cup of water from the river, but he war past
nourishment&mdash;and she asked him if he knew he war dyin'?</p>

<p>"He gasped, 'Yes, mother, and may the Lord our God
in heaven be merciful to me, thus cut from you and life, mother&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'God's will be done,' cried my mother, as the pale face
of her darlin' boy fell upon her hand&mdash;he was gone.</p>

<p>"We reached shore, but dar not kindle a light, for
fear the Ingins might be prowlin' about on this side; yes,
under this very tree, did we 'camp that gloomy night.
The whole of us, livin', dead, and wounded, lay 'yer, fearin'
even to weep aloud. About midnight, I took the two
blacks, and we dug yon grave and laid poor Ben in it, and
the two children by his side. It war an awful thing&mdash;awful
to us all; and our sighs and sobs, mingled with the
prayers of the old mother, went to God's footstool, I'm
sure. We made such restin' places as circumstances permitted.
I lay down, but the cries of poor Captain Paul's
wife and sister, cries of the two survivin' children, and moans
of us all, made sleep a difficult affair. By peep of day I
went down to the grave, and thar sat the old mother. She
had sat thar the live-long night; the sudden shock had
been too much for her.</p>

<p>"Two days afterwards the grave was opened and enlarged,
and received two more bodies, the wife of Captain Paul,
and our kind, good old mother. Thirty-five years have
now passed. Could I leave this place? No; not a day
at a time have I missed seeing the grave, when within miles
of it. No, here must I rest too."</p>

<p>The old man seemed deeply affected. I could not refrain
from taking up the thread of his narrative to inquire
what had become of Captain Paul and his wife's sister.</p>

<p>"Well, poor thing, you see it war natural enough for her
to love her sister's children, and the captain, he couldn't
help lovin' her too, for that. The captain settled down here,
about two miles back, and in a few years the sister-in-law
and he war man and wife, and a kind, good old wife she is
too. I've 'camped with 'em ever since, and with 'em I'll
die, and be put thar&mdash;thar, to rest in that little mound with
the rest. But I must bide my time, stranger&mdash;we must all
bide our time. Now, stranger, I've told you my sad story,
I must ax a favor. Seeing as you are a town-bred person,
perhaps a preacher, I want you to kneel down by that
grave and make a prayer. I feel that it is a good thing
to pray, though we woods people know but little about it."</p>

<p>I told him I was not a minister in the common acceptation
of the term, but considering we all are God's ministers
that study God's will and our own duty to man, I could
pray, did pray, and left the poor woodsman with an exalted
feeling, I hope, of divine and infinite grace to all who seek it.</p>

<p>A boat touched Vevay that evening, and I left, deeply
impressed with this little story.</p>

<p>Meanness is as natural to some people, as gutta percha
beefsteaks in a cheap boarding-house. Schoodlefaker says
he saw a striking instance in Quincy market last Saturday.
An Irish woman came up to a turkey merchant, and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>"What wud yees be after axin' for nor a chicken like that?"</p>

<p>"That's a turkey, not a chicken," says the merchant.</p>

<p>"Turkey? Be dad an' it's a mighty small turkey&mdash;it's
stale enough, too, I'd be sworn; poor it is, too! What'd
yees ax for 'un?"</p>

<p>"Well, seein' it's pooty nigh night, and the last I've got,
I'll let you have it for <i>two and six</i>."</p>

<p>"Two and six? Hoot! I'd give yees half a dollar fur

<p>"Well," says the <i>satisfied</i> poultry merchant, "take it
along; I won't dicker for a cent or two."</p>

<p>Mrs. Doolygan paid over the half, boned the turkey, and
went on her way quite elated with the brilliancy of her
talents in financiering! There's one merit in meanness, if
it disgusts the looker-on, it never fails to carry a pleasing
sensation to the bosom of the gamester.</p>

<p>Office-Seeking has become a legitimatized branch
of our every-day business, as much so as in former times
"reduced gentlemen" took to keeping school or posting books.
In former times, men took to politics to give zest to a life
already replete with pecuniary indulgences, as those in the
"sere and yellow leaf" are wont to take to religion as a
solacing comfort against things that are past, and pave the
way to a very desirable futurity. But now, politicians are
of no peculiar class or condition of citizens; the success of
a champion depends not so much upon the matter, as upon
the manner, not upon the capital he may have in real estate,
bank funds or public stocks, but upon the fundamental
principle of "confidence," gutta percha lungs and unmistakable
amplitude of&mdash;brass and bravado! If any man
doubts the fact, let him look around him, and calculate the
matter. Why is it that <i>lawyers</i> are so particularly felicitous
in running for, securing, and usurping most of all the
important or profitable offices under government? Lungs&mdash;gutta
percha lungs and everlasting impudence, does it.
A man might as well try to bail out the Mississippi with a
tea-spoon, or shoot shad with a fence-rail, as to hope for a
seat in Congress, merely upon the possession of patriotic
principles, or double-concentrated and refined integrity.
Why, if George Washington was a Virginia farmer to-day,
his chance for the Presidency wouldn't be a circumstance
to that of Rufus Choate's, while there is hardly a lawyer
attached to the Philadelphia bar that would not beat the
old gentleman out of his top boots in running for the
Senate! But we'll <i>cut</i> "wise saws" for a modern instance;
let us attend a small "caucus" where incipient Demostheneses,
Ciceros, and Mark Antonies most do congregate,
and see things "workin'." It is night, a ward meeting of
the unterrified, meat-axe, non-intervention&mdash;hats off&mdash;hit
him again&mdash;butt-enders, have called a meeting to <i>caucus</i> for
the coming fall contest. "Owing to the inclemency of the
weather," and other causes too tedious to mention, of some
eight hundred of the <i>unterrified, non-intervention&mdash;Cuban
annexation&mdash;Wilmot proviso, compromise, meat-axe, hats
off&mdash;hit him again&mdash;butt-enders</i>&mdash;only eighty attend the
call. Of these eighty faithful, some forty odd are on the
wing for office; one at least wants to work his way up to
the gubernatorial chair, five to the Senate, ten to the
"Assembly," fifteen to the mayoralty, and the balance to
the custom house.</p>

<p>Now, before the "curtain rises," little knots of the
anxious multitude are seen here and there about the corners
of the adjacent neighborhood and in the recesses of the
caucus chamber, their heads together&mdash;caucusing on a
small scale.</p>

<p>"Flambang, who'd you think of puttin' up to-night for
the <i>Senate</i>, in our ward?" asks a cadaverous, but earnest
<i>unterrified</i>, of a brother in the same cause.</p>

<p>"Well, I swan, I don't know; what do you think of Jenkins?"</p>

<p>"Jenkins?" leisurely responded the first speaker; "Jenkins
is a pooty good sort of a man, but he ain't known;
made himself rather unpop'ler by votin' agin that <i>grand
junction railroad to the north pole</i> bill, afore the Legislature,
three years ago; besides he's served two years in the
Legislature, and been in the custom house two years; talks
of going to California or somewhere else, next spring&mdash;so
I-a, I-a&mdash;don't think much of Jenkins, anyhow!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," says Flambang, "there's Dr. Rhubarb;
what do you think of him? He's a sound <i>unterrified</i>, good man."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;ye-e-e-s, the doctor's pooty good sort of a man,
but I don't think its good policy to run doctors for office.
If they are defeated it sours their minds equal to cream of
tartar; it spiles their practice, and 'tween you and I, Flambang,
if they takes a spite at a man that didn't vote for
'em, and he gets sick, they're called in; how easy it is <i>for
'em to poison us!</i>"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!&mdash;you don't say so?"</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> say, of course I don't say so of Dr. Rhubarb.
I only supposed a case," replied the wily <i>caucuser</i>.</p>

<p>"A case? Yes-s-s; a feller would be a case, under
them circumstances. I'm down on doctors, then, Twist;
but what do you say to Blowpipes? He's one of our best speakers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Gas!</i>" pointedly responded Twist.</p>

<p>"Gas? Well, you voted for him last year, when he run
for Congress; you were the first man to nominate him, too!"</p>

<p>"So I was, and I voted for him, drummed for him, fifed
and blowed; that was no reason for my thinking him the best
man we had for the office. He's a demagogue, an ambitious,
sly, selfish feller, as we could skeer up; but, he was in our
way, we couldn't get shut of him; I proposed the nomination,
and tried to elect him, so that we should get him out
of the way of our local affairs, and more deserving and less
pretendin' men could get a chance, don't you see? Now,
Flambang, you're the man I'm goin' in for to-night!"</p>

<p>"Me! Mr. Twist? Why, bless your soul, I don't want office!"</p>

<p>"Come, now, don't be modest. I'll lay the ground-work,
you'll be nominated&mdash;I'll not be known in it&mdash;you'll
get the nomination&mdash;called out for a speech&mdash;so be on the
trigger&mdash;give 'em a rouser, and you're in!"</p>

<p>Poor Flambang, a modest, retiring man, peaceable proprietor
of a small shop, in which, by the force of prudence
and economy, he has laid up something, has a voice among
his fellow-citizens and some influence, but would as soon
attempt to carry a blazing pine knot into a powder magazine,
or "ship" for a missionary to the Tongo Islands, as
to run for the Legislature <i>and make a speech in public!</i>
Twist knows it; he guesses shrewdly at the effect.</p>

<p>"Why don't you run?" says Flambang, after many efforts
to get his breath.</p>

<p>"Me? Well, if you don't want to <i>run</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Run?</i> I would as soon think of jumping over the
moon, as running for office!" answers Flambang. "But I
thank you, thank <i>you</i> kindly, for your good intentions, for
<i>your</i> confidence(!), Twist, and whatever good I can do for
you, I'll do, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Twist having secured the first step to his <i>plot</i>, enters the
caucus chamber in deep and earnest consultation with
Flambang, and while preparations are being made to "histe
the rag," he is seen making converts to his sly purposes,
upon the same principle by which he converted his modest
friend, Flambang.</p>

<p>"Who are you going in for to-night?" asks another
"ambitious for distinction" <i>unterrified</i> of "a brother."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; it's hard to tell; good many wants
to be nominated, and good many more than will be," was
the cogent reply.</p>

<p>"That's a fact!" was the equally clear response. "But
'tween you and I, Pepper&mdash;I'd like to get the nomination for
the Senate myself!"</p>

<p>"No-o-o?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; why shouldn't I? Hain't I stood by the party?"</p>

<p>"Well, and hain't I stood by it, hung by it, fastened to it?"</p>

<p>"Pepper, you have; so have I; now, I'll tell you what
I'll do. You hang by me, for the Senate, and I'll go in for
you for the House."</p>

<p>"Agreed; hang by 'em, give 'em a blast, first opening,
and while you are fifing away for me, I'll go around for
you, Captain Johns."</p>

<p>"Flammer, you going to go in for Smithers, to-night?"
asks another of "the party," of a confederate.</p>

<p>"Smithers? I don't know about that; I don't think
he's the right kind of a man for mayor, any how; do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know he's an almighty peart chap in talkin',
and I guess he'll be elected, if he's nominated and goes around
speaking; but here he is; let's feel his pulse." After a
confab of some minutes between Flammer, Smithers, and
Skyblue, things seem to be fixed to mutual satisfaction,
and <ins title="someting">something</ins> is "dropped" about "go in for me for the
Mayoralty, I'll go in for you for the Senate," etc.</p>

<p>"Don't let on, that I'm <i>anxious</i>, at all, you know," says
Smithers, to which the two allies Skyblue and Flammer
respond&mdash;"O, of course not!"</p>

<p>Now the curtain rises, the meeting's organized, with as
much formality, fuss and fungus as the opening of the
House of Parliament; soon is heard the work of balloting
for nominations, and soon it is known that <i>Twist</i> is <i>the</i>
man for the Senate&mdash;this calls <i>Twist</i> out; he spreads&mdash;feels
overpowered&mdash;this unexpected (!) event&mdash;attending as a
spectator, not anticipating any thing for himself&mdash;proud of
the unexpected honor&mdash;had long served as a <i>private</i> in the
ranks of the <i>unterrified</i>&mdash;die in the front of battle, if his
friends thought proper, etc., etc. And Twist falls back,
mid great applause of the multitude, to give way to Capt.
Johns, who also felt overpowered by the unexpected rush
of honor put upon him, in connecting his name with the
senatorial ticket. He was proud of being thought capable
of serving his country, etc., etc.; gave his friend Pepper
"a first-rate notice." Pepper was nominated, made a
speech, and so highly piled up the agony in favor of
Smithers, that Smithers was nominated&mdash;made a speech in
favor of Skyblue and Flammer, upon the force of which
both were nominated&mdash;the wheel within a wheel worked
elegant; and the organs next day were sublimely eloquent
upon the result of the grand caucus&mdash;candidates&mdash;unanimity&mdash;etc.,
etc., of these subterranean politicians. So are
our great men manufactured for the public.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="The_Wolf_Slayer" id="The_Wolf_Slayer"></a>The Wolf Slayer.</h2>


<p>In 1800 the most of the State of Ohio, and nearly all
of Indiana, was a dense wilderness, where the gaunt wolf
and naked savage were masters of the wild woods and fertile
plains, which now, before the sturdy blows of the pioneer's
axe, and the farmer's plough, has been with almost
magical effect converted into rich farms and thriving, beautiful villages.</p>

<p>In the early settlement of the west, the pioneers suffered
not only from the ruthless savage, but fearfully from the
<i>wolf</i>. Many are the tales of terror told of these ferocious
enemies of the white man, and his civilization. Many was
the hunter, Indian as well as the Angle-Saxon, whose
bones, made marrowless by the prowling hordes of the dark
forest, have been scattered and bleached upon the war-path
or Indian trail of the back-woods. In 1812-13, my father
was contractor for the north-western army, under command
of Gen. Wm. Henry Harrison. He supplied the army
with beef; he bought up cattle along the Sciota valley and
Ohio river, and drove them out to the army, then located
at Sandusky. Chillicothe, then, was a small settlement on
the Sciota river, and protected by a block house or rude
fort, in which the inhabitants could scramble if the Indians
made their appearance. My father resided here, and having
collected a large drove of cattle, he set out up the valley
with a few mounted men as a kind of guard to protect
the drove against the prowling minions of Tecumseh.</p>

<p>The third day out, late in the afternoon, being very warm
weather, there arose a most terrific thunder-storm; the
huge trees, by the violence of the wind and sharp lightning,
were uprooted and rent into thousands of particles,
and the panic-stricken herd scattered in every direction. I
have seen the havoc made in forests through which one of
these tornadoes has taken its way, or I should be incredulous
to suppose whole acres of trees, hundreds of years
old, could be torn up, or snapped off like reeds upon the river side.</p>

<p>The fury of the whirlwind seemed to increase as the night
grew darker, until cattle, men and horses, were killed, crippled
and dispersed. My father crawled under the lee of a large
sycamore that had fell, and here, partly protected from the
rain and falling timber, he lay down. I have camped out
some, and can readily anticipate the comfort of the old gentleman's
situation, and not at all disposed was he to go to
sleep mounted upon such guard.</p>

<p>At length the work of destruction and ruin being done,
the storm abated, the rain ceased to <i>pour</i> and the winds to
wag their noisy tongues so furiously. A wolf <i>howl</i>, and of
all fearful howls, or yelps uttered by beasts of prey, none
can, I think, be more alarming and terrific to the ear than
the <i>wolf</i> howl as he scents carnage. A wolf howl broke
fearfully upon the drover's ear as he lay crouched beneath
the sycamore. It was a familiar sound, and therefore, and
<i>then</i> the more dreadful. The drover carried a good Yeager
rifle, knife, and pistols, but a man laden with arms in the
midst of a troop of famished wolves, was as helpless as the
tempest-tossed mariner in the midst of the ocean's storm.
The <i>howl</i> had scarcely echoed over the dark wood, before
it was answered by dozens on every side! And as the
drover's keen eye pierced the gloom around him, the dancing,
fiery glare of the wolf's eyes met his wistful gaze.</p>

<p>The forest now resounded with the maddened banqueting
beast, and as the glaring eyes came nearer and nearer,
the drover hugged his Yeager tightly, and prepared to defend
life while yet it lasted. Suddenly the sharp crack
of a rifle was heard, and then a loud scream or cry of terror
burst upon the air, a rushing sound, a man pursued by a
troop of wolves fled by the drover and his cover; scream
after scream rent the air, and the drover knew that a companion
had fell a victim to the wolf in his attempt at self-defence.
The night was a long one, and thus, among the
savage beasts, a fearful one. The report of another rifle
again broke upon the ear, and again, and again did the
hunting iron speak, and the wolf howl salute it. A pair
of eyes glared hurriedly upon the drover, and he could not
resist the desire to use his Yeager, and the wolf taking the
contents of the rifle in his mouth, rolled over, while a score
rushed up to fill his place. Oh! how dreadful must have
been the suspense and feelings of the drover as he lay
crouched under the old tree, surrounded by this horde of
glaring eyes, his ears split with their awful <i>howl</i>, and their
hot and venomous breath fairly in his face! But the wolf
is a base coward, and will not meet a man eye to eye, and
so protected lay the drover, with his clenched teeth and
unquivering eye, that the wolf had no chance to attack,
but by rushing up to his very front. The red tongue
lapped, the fierce teeth were arrayed and the demon eyes
glaring, but the drover quailed not, and the cowardly wolf
stood at bay. The sharp crack of the distant rifle still
smote upon the air and the loud howl still went up over the
forest around. The first faint streaks that deck the sky at
morn, the fresh breath of coming day caught the keen scent
of the bloody prowlers, and they began to skulk off. The
drover gave the retreating cowards a farewell shot from his
pistols, tumbled a lank, grey demon over, and the wolf howl
soon died off in the distance.</p>

<p>Daylight now appeared, and the drover crawled from his
lair. His loud <i>whoop!</i> to the disbanded men and drove
was answered by the neigh of a horse, who came galloping
up, and proved to be his own good hunter, who seemed
happy indeed to meet his master. Another <i>whoop-e</i> brought
a responsive shout, and finally four men out of the twelve,
with seven horses and a few straggling cattle, were mustered.
The forest was strewn with torn carcasses of cattle and
horses, mostly killed by the falling timber, and partly devoured
by the ravenous wolves. A few hundred yards
from the tree where the drover lay, was found a few fragments
of clothes, the knife and rifle, and a half-eaten body
of one of the soldiers. He had fought with the desperation
of a mad man, and the dead and crippled wolves lay
as trophies around the bold soldier. In a hollow near the
river they found a horse and man partly eaten up, and several
cattle that had apparently been hotly pursued and torn
to death by the rapacious beasts. They started out in
search of the spot from whence the drover had heard the
firing in the night. They soon discovered the place; at the
foot of a large dead sycamore stump, some twelve feet high
lay the carcasses of a dozen or twenty wolves. Each wolf
had his scalp neatly taken off, and his head elaborately
bored by the rifle ball. An Indian ladder, that is, a scrubby
saplin', trimmed with footholds left on it, was laying against
the old tree, at the top of which was a sort of a rude scaffold,
contrived, evidently, by a hunter. At a distance, in a
hollow, was seen a great profusion of wolf skulls and bones,
but no sign of a human being could there be traced. The
party made a fire, and as beef lay plenty around, they regaled
themselves heartily, after their night of horror and
disaster. Having finished their repast, they separated,
each taking different courses to hunt and drive up such of
the stray cattle as could be found. My father, whom I have
designated as the drover, pursued his way over the vast
piles of fallen, tangled timber, leaping from one tree to the
other. As he was about to throw himself over the trunk
of a mighty prostrate oak, he found himself within two
feet of one of the largest and most ferocious wolves that
ever expanded its broad jaws and displayed its fierce tushes
to the eye of man. Both parties were taken so suddenly
by surprise, by this collision, that they seemed to be rooted
to the spot without power to move. I have heard of serpents
charming birds, said the drover, but I never believed
in the theory until I found myself fairly magnetized by this
great she-wolf. The wolf stood and snarled with its golden
fiery eye bent upon the drover, who never moved his steady
gaze from the wolf's face.</p>

<p>There is not a beast in existence that will attack a man
if he keeps his eyes steady upon the animal, but will cower
and sneak off, and so did the wolf. But no sooner had she
turned her head and with a howl started off, than a blue
pill from the drover's Yeager split her skull, and brought
her career to a speedy termination.</p>

<p><i>Whoo-ep!</i></p>

<p>A shout so peculiar to the lusty lungs of the western
hunter made the welkin ring again, and as the astonished
drover turned towards the shouter, he beheld a sight that
proved quite as formidable as the wolf he had just slain.</p>

<p>"Well done, stranger; you're the man for me; I like
you. That shot done my heart good, though I was about
to do the old she devil's business for ye, seeing as you war
sort o' close quartered with the varmint."</p>

<p>"Thank you," responded the drover, addressing the
speaker, a tall, gaunt, iron-featured, weather-beaten figure,
with long grey hair, and a rude suit of wolf-skin clothing,
cap and moccasins. He held in his long arms a large rifle,
a knife in his belt, and a powder horn slung over his side.
He seemed the very patriarch of the woods, but good humored,
and with his rough hilarity soon explained his presence there.</p>

<p>"Well, stranger," said he, "you have had a mighty
chance of bad luck yer last night, and I never saw them
cursed varmints so crazy afore."</p>

<p>"Do you live in these parts?" inquired the drover.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! yes, yes," replied the hunter. "I live yer,
I live anywhar's whar wolf can be found. But you don't
know me, I reckon, stranger?"</p>

<p>"I do not," said the drover.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! well, that's quare, mighty quare. I thought
thar warn't a man this side the blue ridge but what knows
me and old <i>kit</i> here, (his rifle.) Well, seeing you are a
stranger, I'll just take that old sarpent's top-knot off, and
have a talk with ye."</p>

<p>With this introductory of matters, the hunter in the wolf-skins
scalped the wolf, and tucking the scalp in his belt,
motioned the drover to follow. He led the way in deep
silence some half a mile to a small stream, down which
they proceeded for some distance, until they came to a low
and rudely-constructed cabin. Here the hunter requested
the drover to take a seat on a log, in front of the cabin,
while he entered through a small aperture in his hut,
and brought forth a pipe, tobacco, and some dried meat.
These dainties being discussed, old Nimrod the mean time
kept chuckling to himself, and mumbling over the idea that
there should be a white man or <i>Ingin</i> this side the blue
ridge that didn't know <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! well, well, I swar, it is curious, stranger, that
you don't know me, <i>me</i> that kin show more <i>Ingin</i> skelps
than any white man that ever trod these war paths; <i>me</i>,
who kin shoot more wolves and fetch in more of the varmints'
skelps in one night than any white man or <i>Ingin</i> that
ever trod this wilderness. But I'm gittin' old, very old,
forgotten, and here comes a white man clean and straight
from the settlements and he don't know me; I swar I've
lived to be clean ashamed o' myself." And with this soliloquy,
half to himself and partly addressed to the drover,
the old hunter seemed almost fit to cry, at his imaginary
insignificance and dotage.</p>

<p>"But, friend," said the drover, "as you have not yet informed
me by what name I may call you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Call</i> me, stranger? why I <i>am</i>"&mdash;and here his eyes
glared as he threw himself into a heroic attitude&mdash;"Chris
Green, <i>old</i> Chris Green, the <i>wolf slayer!</i> But, God bless
ye, stranger, p'r'aps you're from t'other side the ridge, and
don't know old Chris's history."</p>

<p>"That I frankly admit," replied the drover.</p>

<p>"Well, God bless ye, I love my fellow white men, yes, I
do, though I live yer by myself, and clothe myself with the
varmints' skins, go but seldom to the settlements, and live
on what old kit thar provides me.</p>

<p>"Well, stranger, my history's a mighty mournful one,
but as yer unlucky like myself and plenty of business to
'tend to 'fore night, I'll make my troubles short to ye.</p>

<p>"Well, you see about thirty years ago, I left the blue
ridge with a party of my neighbors to come down yer in
the Sciota country, to see it, and lay plans to drive the
cussed red skins clean out of it. Well, the red skins
appeared rather quiet, what few we fell in with, and
monstrous civil. But cuss the sarpints, there's no more
dependence to be put in 'em than the <ins title="catankerous">cantankerous</ins> wolves,
and roast 'em, I always sets old kit talkin' Dutch to
them varmints, the moment I claps eyes on 'em. The
wolf's my nat'ral inimy&mdash;I'd walk forty miles to git old kit
a wolf skelp. Well, we travelled all over the valley, and
we gin it as our opinion that the Sciota country was the
garden spot o' the world, and if we could only defend ourselves
'gainst the inimy we should move right down yer at
once. We went back home, and the next spring a hull
settlement on us came down yer. My neighbors thought
it best for us all to settle down together at Chillicothe, whar
a few Ingin huts and cabins war. I had a wife, and son
and da'ter; now, stranger, I loved 'em as dearer to me 'nor
life or heart's blood itself. Well, the red skins soon began
to show their pranks&mdash;they stole our cre'ters (horses), shot
down our cattle, and made all manner o' trouble for the
little settlement. At last I proposed we should build a
clever-sized block house, strong and stanch, in which our
wimen folks and children, with a few men to guard 'em,
could hold out a few days, while a handful o' us scoured
Paint hills and the country about, and peppered a few of
the cussed red devils. We had been out some four or five
days when we fell in with the inimy; it war just about
sunset, and the red skins war camped in a hollow close by
this spot. We intended to let 'em get through their smoking
and stretch themselves for the night, and then squar
our accounts with 'em. Stranger, I've lived in these woods
thirty years, I never saw such a hurricane as we had yer
last night, 'cept once. The night we lay in ambush for the
<i>Ingins</i>, six-and-twenty years ago, thar came up a hurricane,
the next mornin' eleven of the bodies of my neighbors lay
crushed along the bottom yer, and for a hundred miles
along the Sciota, whar the hurricane passed, the great
walnuts and sycamore lay blasted, root and branch, just as
straight as ye'd run a bee line; no timber grow'd upon
these bottoms since. Five on us escaped the hurricane,
but before day we fell in with a large party of red skins,
and we fought 'em like devils; three on us fell; myself and
the only neighbor left war obliged to fly to the hills. I
made my way to the settlement.</p>

<p>"Stranger, when I looked down from the hills of Paint
creek, and saw the block house scattered over the bottom,
and not a cabin standin' or a livin' cre'ter to be seen in the
settlement of Chillicothe, my heart left me; I become a
woman at once, and sot down and cry'd as if I'd been
whipped to death." The old man's voice grew husky, and
the tears suffused his eyes, but after a few sighs and a tear,
he proceeded:</p>

<p>"Well, you see, stranger, a man cannot always be a child,
nor a woman, either; my crying spell appeared to ease my
heart amazin'ly. I shouldered old kit here, and down I
went to examine things. The hurricane had scattered
every thing; the fire had been at work too, but, great God!
the bloody <i>wolf</i> had been thar, the settlement was kivered
with the bloody bones of my own family and friends; if any
had escaped the hurricane, the fire or wolf, the <i>Ingins</i> finished
'em, for I never seen 'em afterwards; I couldn't bear
to stay about the place, I'd no home, friend, or kindred. I
took to the woods, and swore eternal death to the red skins
and my nat'ral inimy, the <i>wolf!</i> I've been true to my
word, stranger; that cabin is lined with skelps and ornamented
with Ingin <i>top-knots!</i> Look in, ha! ha! see there!
they may well call old Chris the <i>Wolf Slayer!</i>"</p>

<p>The drover regaled his eyes on the trophies of the old
forlorn hunter, and then visited the <i>perch</i>, which was situated
close by a "deer lick," where wolves resorted to fall
upon their victims. And from this <i>perch</i> old <i>Wolf Slayer</i>
had made fearful work upon his nat'ral inimy the night previous.
The old hunter assisted, during the day, to collect
such of the scattered drove as yet were alive or to be found;
the men came with another of their companions, and the
small drove and men left the scene of terror and disaster,
wishing a God-speed to the <i>Wolf Slayer</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="knew_em_All" id="knew_em_All"></a>The Man that knew 'em All.</h2>


<p>If you have ever "been around" some, and taken notice
of things, you have doubtless seen the man who knows
pretty much every thing and every body!</p>

<p>I've seen them frequently. As the old preacher observed
to a venerable lady, in reference to <i>forerunners</i>, "I see
'em now." Well, talking of that rare and curious specimen
of the human family, the man that knows every body,
I've rather an amusing reminiscence of "one of 'em."
Stopping over night at the Virginia House, in that jumping
off place of Western Virginia, Wheeling, some years
ago, I had the pleasure or pastime of meeting several of
the big guns of the nation, on their way from Washington
city, home. It was in August, I think, when, as is most
generally the case, the Ohio river gets monstrous low and
feeble; when all of the large steamers are past getting up
so far, and travelling down the river becomes quite amusing
to amateurs, and particularly tedious and monotonous
to business people, bound home. Three hundred travellers,
more or less, were laying back at the "Virginia" and
"United States," in the aforesaid hardscrabble of a city,
or town, waiting for the river to get up, or some means for
them to get down.</p>

<p>The session of Congress had closed at Washington, some
time before, and as almost all of the M. C.'s, U. S. S.'s,
wire pullers, hangers on, blacklegs, horse jockeys, etc., etc.,
came over "the National Road" to Wheeling, to take the
river for Southern and Western destinations, of course the
assemblage at that place, at that time, was promiscuous,
and quite interesting; at least, Western and Southern men
always make themselves happy and interesting, home or
abroad, and particularly so when travelling. It was a glorious
thing for the proprietors of the hotels, to have such
a host of guests, as a house full of company always is a
"host," the guests having nothing else to do but lay back,
eat, drink, and be merry, and foot the bills when ready, or
when opportunity offers, to&mdash;&mdash; go.</p>

<p>They drank and smoked, and drank again, and told jests,
and played games and tricks, and thus passed the time
along. Among the multitude was one of those ever-talkative
and chanting men of the world, who knew all places
and all men&mdash;as <i>he</i> would have it. Just after removing the
cloth, at dinner, a knot of the old jokers, bacchanalians and
wits, settled away in a cluster, at the far end of a long
table, and were having a very pleasant time. The man of
all talk was there; he was the very <i>nucleus</i> of all that was
being said or done. He was from below, somewhere, on
his way, as he informed the crowd, to Washington city,
upon affairs of no slight importance to himself and the
country in general.</p>

<p>"Oho!" says one of the party, a sly, winking, fat and
rosy gentleman, whom we shall designate hereafter, "you're
bound to the capital, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>," responded the man of all talk.</p>

<p>"Of course you've been there before?" says the interrogator,
nudging a friend, and winking at the rest.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i> Me been in Washington before? Ha, ha! <i>me</i> been
<i>there</i> before! Bless you, me <i>been</i> in Washington city!"</p>

<p>"Oho! ha, ha!" says the interrogator, "you're one of
the caucus folks, eh? One of them wire pullers we read
about, eh?"</p>

<p>"<i>Me?</i> Caucus? Ha, ha! Mum's the word, gents,
(looking killingly cunning.) Come, gentlemen, let's fill up.
Ha, ha! me pulling the&mdash;ha, ha! Well, here's to the old
Constitution; let's hang by her, while there's a&mdash;a&mdash;a button
on Jabe's coat."</p>

<p>And they all responded, of course, to this eloquent sentiment.</p>

<p>"Here's to Jabe's buttons, coat, hat, and breeches."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," continued the first operator, after the
toast was wet down, "you'll please excuse me, in behalf
of some of my friends here; as you've been down in that
dratted place, and must know a good deal of the goings on
there, I'd like to inquire about a few things we Western
folks don't more than get an inkling of, through the papers."</p>

<p>"Certainly; go on, sir," says the victim, assuming all the
dignity and depth of a man that's appealed to to settle a
ponderous matter.</p>

<p>"I'd like to inquire if those Kitchen Cabinet disclosures
of the Pennsylvania Senator, were true. Had you ever any
means of satisfying yourself that there is, or was, a real service
of gold in the President's house?"</p>

<p>"Aye! that's what we'd all like to know," says another.</p>

<p>"How many pieces were there?"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> were they?"</p>

<p>"Aye, and what their <i>heft</i> was?"</p>

<p>"Mum, gentlemen; let's drink&mdash;no tales out of school,
ha, ha! No, no&mdash;mum's the word." And looking funny
and deep, merry and wise, all at one and the same time, the
man of all talk proposed to drink and keep&mdash;&mdash; <i>mum</i>.</p>

<p>But they wouldn't drink, and insisted on the secret being
let out&mdash;they wanted a decided and positive answer, from a
man who knew the ropes.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the victim, dropping his voice into a
sort of melo-dramatic stage whisper, and stooping quite
over the table, so as to collect the several heads and ears
as close into a phalanx as possible: "gentlemen, it's a <i>fact!</i>"</p>

<p>"What?" says the party.</p>

<p>"All gold!" says the victim.</p>

<p>"A gold service?" inquires the party.</p>

<p>"<i>Thirty-eight pieces!</i>" continued the victim.</p>

<p>"Solid gold?" chimed the rest.</p>

<p>"<i>Just half a ton in heft!</i>"</p>

<p>"You don't tell us <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Know it; eat out of 'em, <i>then weighed 'em all!</i>"</p>

<p>"P-h-e-w!" whistled some, while others went into
stronger exclamations.</p>

<p>"<i>Fact, by the great</i>&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, sir; no doubt of it now, sir," said
the mover of the business, grasping the victim's upraised arm.</p>

<p>"Then, of course, sir, you're well acquainted with Matty
Van; on good terms with the little Magician," continued
the leading wag.</p>

<p>"<i>Me?</i> me on good terms with Matty? Ha, ha! that is
a good joke; never go to Washington without cracking a
bottle with the little fox, and staying over night with him.
<i>Me</i> on good terms with Matty? <i>We've had many a spree
together!</i> Yes, <i>sir!</i>" and the knowing one winked right and left.</p>

<p>"Well, there's old Bullion," continued one of the interrogators,
a fine portly old gent, "you know him, of course?"</p>

<p>"What, Tom Benton? Bless your souls, I don't know
my letters half as well as I know old Tom."</p>

<p>"And Bill Allen, of Ohio?" asked another. "What
sort of a fellow is Bill?"</p>

<p>"Bill Allen? Lord O! isn't he a coon? Bill Allen?
I wish I had a dime for every horn, and game of bluff, we've
had together."</p>

<p>"Well, there's another of 'em," inquiringly asked a fat,
farmer-looking old codger: "Dr. Duncan, how's he stand
down there about Washington?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he's a pretty good sort of an old chap, but,
gents, between you and I, (with another whisper,) there is
a good deal of the 'old fogie' senna and salts about him.
But then he's death and the pale hoss on poker."</p>

<p>"What, Doctor Duncan?" says they.</p>

<p>"Why, y-e-e-s, of course. Didn't he skin me out of my
watch last winter, playing poker, at Willard's?"</p>

<p>"Well," continued the fat farmer-looking man, "I didn't
know Duncan <i>gambled</i>?"</p>

<p>"Mum, not a word out of school; ha, ha! Let's drink,
gents. Gamble? Lord bless you, it's common as dish-water
down there&mdash;I've played euchre for hours with old Tom
Benton, Harry Clay and Gen. Scott, <i>right behind the speaker's chair!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Then</i> they all <i>drank</i>, of course, and some of the party
liked to have choked. The company now proposed to adjourn
to the smoking room, and they arose and left the
table accordingly. The man of all talk promenaded out
on to the steps, and in course of half an hour, says the
leading spirit of the late dinner, or wine party, to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Ferguson, sir; George Adolphus Ferguson is my address,
sir," responded the victim.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferguson, did you know that your friend Benton
was in town?" inquired the wag.</p>

<p>"What, Tom Benton here?"</p>

<p>"And Allen," continued the wag.</p>

<p>"What, Bill Allen, too?" says the victim.</p>

<p>"And Doctor Duncan."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me all them fellows are here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, your friends are all here. Come in and see
them; your friends will be delighted," says the wag, taking
Mister Ferguson by the arm, to lead him in.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! I'm a&mdash;a&mdash;ha, ha! <i>won't</i> we have a time? But
you just step in&mdash;I a&mdash;I'll be in in one moment," but in less
than half the time, Mr. Ferguson mizzled, no one knew whither!</p>

<p>The gentlemen at the table, it is almost needless to say,
were no others than Benton, Allen, Duncan, and some three
or four other arbiters of the fate of our immense and glorious
nation, in her councils, and fresh from the capital.</p>

<p>Ferguson has not been heard of since.</p>

<h2><a name="Spell_of_Sickness" id="Spell_of_Sickness"></a>A Severe Spell of Sickness.</h2>


<p>It is the easiest thing under heaven to be sick, if you
can afford it. What it costs some rich men for family
sickness per annum, would keep all the children in "a poor
neighborhood" in "vittels" and clothes the year round.
When old Cauliflower took sick, once in a long life-time, he
was prevailed upon to send for Dr. Borax, and it was some
weeks before Cauliflower got down stairs again. At the end
of the year Dr. Borax sent in his bill; the amount gave
Cauliflower spasms in his pocket-book, and threatened a
whole year's profits with strangulation.</p>

<p>"Doctor," says Cauliflower, "that bill of yours is all-fired
steep, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," says Borax; "your case was a dangerous case&mdash;I
never raised a man from the grave with such difficulty,

<h2><a name="of_the_Aldermen" id="of_the_Aldermen"></a>The Race of the Aldermen.</h2>


<p>In 183-, it chanced in the big city of New York, that
the aldermen elect were a sort of <i>tie</i>; that is, so many
whigs and so many democrats. Such a thing did not occur
often, the democracy usually having the supremacy. They
generally had things pretty much all their own way, and
distributed their favors among their partizans accordingly.
The whigs at length <i>tied</i> them, and the <i>locos</i>, beholding
with horror and misgivings, the new order of things which
was destined to turn out many a holder of fat office, many
a pat-riot overflowing with democratic patriotism, whose
devotion to the cause of the country was manifest in the
tenacity with which he clung to his place, were extremely
anxious to devise ways and means to keep the whigs at
bay; and as the day drew near, when the assembled Board of
Aldermen should have their sitting at the City Hall, various
<i>dodges</i> were proposed by the locos to out-vote the whigs, in
questions or decisions touching the distribution of places,
and appointment of men to fill the various stations of the
new municipal government.</p>

<p>"I have it&mdash;I've got it!" exclaimed a round and jolly
alderman of a democratic ward. "To-night the Board
meets&mdash;we stand about eight and eight&mdash;this afternoon, let
two of us invite two of the whigs, Alderman H&mdash;&mdash; and
Alderman J&mdash;&mdash;, out to a dinner at Harlem, get H&mdash;&mdash;
and J&mdash;&mdash; tight as wax, and then we can slip off, take our
conveyance, come in, and vote the infernal whigs just where
we want them!"</p>

<p>"Capital! prime! Ha, ha, ha!" says one.</p>

<p>"First rate! elegant! ha, ha, ha!" shouts another.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! haw! haw! he, he, he!" roared all the locys.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, let's all throw in a V apiece, to defray
expenses; we, you know, of course, must put the whigs
<i>through</i>, and we must give them a rouse they won't forget
soon. Champagne and turtle, that's the ticket; coach for
four <i>out</i> and two <i>in</i>. Ha, ha!&mdash;The whigs shall see the elephant!"</p>

<p>Well, the purse was made up, the coach hired, and the
two victims, the poor whigs, were carted out under the
pretence of a grand aldermanic feast to Harlem, the scene
of many a spree and jollification with the city fathers, and
other bon vivants and gourmands of Gotham.</p>

<p>Dinner fit for an emperor being discussed, sundry bottles
of "Sham" were uncorked, and their effervescing contents
decanted into the well-fed bodies of the four aldermen.
Toasts and songs, wit and humor, filled up the time, until
the democrats began to think it was time that one of them
slipped out, took the carriage back to the city, leaving the
other to <i>fuddle</i> the two whigs, and detain them until affairs
at "the Tea Room," City Hall, were settled to the entire
satisfaction of the democrats.</p>

<p>"Landlord," says one of the democrats, whom we will
call Brown, "landlord, have you any conveyance, horses,
wagons, carriages or carts, by which any of my friends
could go back to town to-night, if they wish?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," says the landlord, "certainly&mdash;I can send the
gentlemen in if they wish."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir,&mdash;they may get very <i>tight</i> before they
desire to return&mdash;they are men of families, respectable citizens,
and I do not wish them, under any circumstances, to
leave your house until morning. Whatever the bill is I will
foot, provided you deny them any of your means to go in
to-night. You understand!"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, sir&mdash;if you request it as a matter of favor,
that I shall keep your friends here, I will endeavor to do
so&mdash;but hadn't you better attend to them yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," says Brown, "I have business of importance
to transact&mdash;must be in town this evening. Give
the party all they wish&mdash;put that in your fob&mdash;(handing the
host an X)&mdash;post up your bill in the morning, and I'll be
out bright and early to make all square. Do you hark?"
says Brown.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir&mdash;all right," responded the landlord.</p>

<p>Brown gave his confederate the <i>cue</i>, stepped out, promising
to "be in in a minute," and then, getting into a
carriage, he drove back to the city, almost tickled to death
with the idea of how nicely the whigs would be "dished"
when they all met at the City Hall, and came up minus <i>two!</i></p>

<p>Smith, Brown's loco friend, did his best to keep the
thing up, by calling in the New Jersey thunder and lightning&mdash;vulgarly
known as Champagne&mdash;and even walked
into the aforesaid t. and l. so deeply himself, that a man with
half an eye might see Smith would be as blind as an owl
in the course of the evening. But Smith was bound to do
the thing up brown, and thought no sacrifice too great or
too expensive to preserve the loaves and fishes of his party.
All of a sudden, however, night was drawing on a pace,
the whigs began to smell a <i>mice</i>. The absence of Brown,
and the excessive politeness and liberality of Smith, in hurrying
up the bottles, settled it in the minds of the whigs,
that something was going on dangerous to the whig cause,
and that they had better look out&mdash;<i>and so they did</i>.</p>

<p>"Jones," says one of the whigs, <i>sotto voce</i>, to the other,
"Brown has cleared; it is evident he and Smith calculate
to corner us here, prevent your presence in 'the Tea Room'
to-night, and thus defeat your vote."</p>

<p>"The deuce! You don't think that, Hall, do you?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I do; but we won't be caught napping. Waiter,
bring in a bottle of brandy."</p>

<p>"Brandy?" said Smith, in astonishment. "Why, you
ain't going to dive right into it, in that way, are you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" says Hall. "Brandy's the best thing in
the world to settle your nerves after getting half fuddled
on Champagne, my boy; just you try it&mdash;take a good stiff
horn. Brown, you see, has <i>cut</i>, we must follow; so let's
straighten up and get ready for a start. Here's to 'the
loaves and fishes.'" Jones and Hall took their horns of
Cogniac, which does really make some men sober as judges
after they are very drunk on real or spurious Champagne.</p>

<p>"Well," says Smith, "it's my opinion we'll all be very
<i>tight</i> going in this way, brandy on Champagne; but here
goes to the fishes and loaves&mdash;the loaves and fishes, I mean."</p>

<p>The brandy had a rather contrary effect from what it does
usually; it did <i>settle</i> Smith&mdash;in five minutes he was so very
"boozy" that his chin bore down upon his breast, he became
as "limber as a rag," and snored like a pair of bagpipes.</p>

<p>"Now, Jones," says Hall, "let's be off. Landlord, get
us a gig, wagon, carriage, cart, any thing, and let's be off;
we must be in town immediately."</p>

<p>"Sorry, gentlemen, but can't oblige you&mdash;haven't a vehicle
on the premises!"</p>

<p>"Why, confound it, you don't pretend to say you can't
send us into town to-night, do you?" says Jones, waxing uneasy.</p>

<p>"Haven't you a horse, jackass, mule or a wheelbarrow&mdash;any
thing, so we can be carted in, right off, too?" says Hall.</p>

<p>"Can't help it, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"What time do the <i>cars</i> come along?" eagerly inquires Jones.</p>

<p>"About nine o'clock," coolly replies the host.</p>

<p>"Nine fools!" shouted the discomfited alderman. "But
this won't do; come, Jones, no help for it&mdash;can't fool us in
that way&mdash;eight miles to the City Hall&mdash;two hours to do it
in; off coat and <i>let's foot it!</i>"</p>

<p>The City Hall clock had just struck 7 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, the Tea
Room was lighted up, the assembled wisdom of the municipal
government had their toadies, and reporters and lookers-on
were there; the room was quite full. Brown was
there, in the best of spirits, and the locos all fairly snorted
with glee at the scientific manner in which Brown had
"done" Jones and Hall out of their votes! The business
of the evening was climaxing: the whigs missing two of
their number, were in quite a spasm of doubt and fear.
The chairman called the meeting to order. The roll was
called: seven "good and true" locos answered the call.
Six whigs had answered: the seventh was being called: the
locos were grinning, and twisting their fingers at the apex
of their noses!</p>

<p>"Alderman Jones! Alderman Jones!" bawled the roll-caller.</p>

<p>"Here!" roared the missing individual, bursting into the room.</p>

<p>"Alderman Hall!" continued the roll.</p>

<p>"Here!" responded that notable worthy, rushing in, entirely blowed out.</p>

<p>"Beat, by thunder!" roared the locos, in grand chorus;
and in the modern classics of the Bowery, "they wasn't
any thing else." The whigs not only had the cut but the
entire <i>deal</i> in the appointments that time, and Alderman
Brown had a <i>bill</i> at Harlem, a little more serious to foot
than the racing of the aldermen to get a chance to vote.</p>

<p>It seems to be just as natural for a subordinate in a
"grocery" to levy upon the <i>till</i>, for material aid to his
own pocket, as for the sparks to fly upwards or water run
down hill. Innumerable stories are told of the peculations
of these "light-fingered gentry," but one of the best of
the boodle is a story we are now about to dress up and trot
out, for your diversion.</p>

<p>A tavern-keeper in this city, some years ago, advertised
for a bar-keeper, "a young man from the country preferred!"
Among the several applicants who exhibited
themselves "for the vacancy," was a decent, harmless-looking
youth whose general <i>contour</i> at once struck the tavern-keeper
with most favorable impressions.</p>

<p>"So you wish to try your hand tending bar?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said he.</p>

<p>"Have you ever tended bar?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but I do not doubt my ability to learn."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you can learn fast enough," says the tavern-keeper.
"In fact, I'm glad you are green at the business,
you will suit me the better; the last fellow I had come to
me recommended as one of the best bar-keepers in New
Orleans; he was posted up in all the fancy drinks and fancy
names, he wore fancy clothes and had a fancy dog, and I
fancied pretty soon that the rascal had taken a fancy to my
small change, so I discharged him in double quick time."</p>

<p>"Served him right, sir," said the new applicant.</p>

<p>"Of course I did. Well now, sir, I'll engage you; you
can get the 'run' of things in a few weeks. I will give you
twenty-five dollars a month, first month, and thirty dollars a
month for the balance of the year."</p>

<p>"I'll accept it, sir," says the youth.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's enough?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, indeed, sir!"</p>

<p>"Well," says Boniface. "Now mark me, young man,
I will pay you, punctually, but you mustn't pay yourself
extra wages!"</p>

<p>"Pay myself?" says the unsophisticated youth.</p>

<p>"Musn't take 'the run' of the till!"</p>

<p>"Run of the till?"</p>

<p>"No knocking down, sir!"</p>

<p>"O, bless you!" quoth the verdant youth, "I am as
good-natured as a lamb; I never knocked any body down
in all my life."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" ejaculated the landlord; "he <i>is</i> green, so I
won't teach him what he don't know. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Absalom Hart, sir."</p>

<p>"Good Christian-like name, and I've no doubt we shall
agree together, for a long time; so go to work."</p>

<p>Absalom "pitched in," a whole year passed, Absalom
and the landlord got along slick as a whistle. Another
year, two, three, four; never was there a more attentive,
diligent and industrious bar-keeper behind a marble slab,
or armed with a toddy stick. He was the <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of bar-keepers, a perfect paragon of toddy mixers. But
one day, somehow or other, the landlord found himself in
custody of the sheriff, bag and baggage. Business had not
fallen off, every thing seemed properly managed, but, somehow
or other, the landlord broke, failed, caved in, and the
sheriff sold him out.</p>

<p>Who bought the concern? Absalom Hart&mdash;nobody
else. Some of the people were astonished.</p>

<p>"Well, who would have thought it?"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Absalom!"</p>

<p>"By George, that was quick work!" were the remarks
of the outsiders, when the fact of the sale and purchase
became known. The landlord felt quite humbled, he was
out of house and home, but he had a friend, surely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hart, things work queer in this world, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Think so?" quietly responded the new landlord.</p>

<p>"I do, indeed; yesterday I was up, and to-day I am down."</p>

<p>"Very true, sir."</p>

<p>"Yesterday you were down, to-day you are up."</p>

<p>"Very true; time works wonders, Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"It does indeed, sir. Now, Mr. Hart, I am out of employment&mdash;got
my family to support; I always trusted I
treated you like a man, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;ye-e-s, you did, I believe."</p>

<p>"Now, I want you to employ me; I have a number of
friends who of course will patronize our house while I am
in it, and you can afford me a fair sort of a living to help you."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Smith," said Mr. Hart, "I suppose I shall
have to hire somebody, and as I don't believe in taking a
raw hand from the country, I will take one who understands
all about it. I'll engage you; so go to work."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Hart." And so the master became the
man, and the man the master.</p>

<p>"Poor Smith, he's down!" cries one old habitue of the
'General Washington' bar-room. "I carkelated he'd gin
out afore long, if he let other people 'tend to his business
instead of himself."</p>

<p>"I didn't like that fellow Absalom, no how," says another
old head; "he's 'bout skin'd Smith."</p>

<p>"Well, Smith kin be savin', he's larnt something," says
a third, "and oughter try to get on to his pegs again."</p>

<p>But when Absalom gave his "free blow," these fellows
all "went in," partook of the landlord's hospitality, and
hoped&mdash;of course they did&mdash;that he might live several thousand
years, and make a fortune!</p>

<p>Time slid on&mdash;Smith was attentive, no bar-keeper more
assiduous and devoted to the toddy affairs of the house,
than Jerry Smith, the pseudo-bar-keeper of Absalom Hart.
Absalom being landlord of a popular drinking establishment,
was surrounded by politicians, horse jockies, and
various otherwise complexioned, fancy living personages.
Ergo, Absalom began to lay off and enjoy himself; he had
his horses, dogs, and other pastimes; got married, and cut it
very "fat." One day he got involved for a friend, got into
unnecessary expenses, was sued for complicated debts, and
so entangled with adverse circumstances, that at the end of
his third year as landlord, the sheriff came in, and the
"General Washington" again came under the hammer.</p>

<p>Now, who will become purchaser? Every body wondered
who would become the next customer.</p>

<p>"I will, by George!" says Smith. And Smith did; he
had worked long and <i>faith</i>fully, and he had saved something.
Smith bought out the whole concern, and once
more he was landlord of the "General Washington."</p>

<p>Absalom was cut down, like a hollyhock in November&mdash;he
was dead broke, and felt, in his present situation, flat,
stale, and unprofitable enough.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith," said Absalom, the day after the collapse,
"I am once more on my oars."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ab, so it seems; it's a queer world, sometimes we
are up, and sometimes we are down. Time, Ab, works
wonders, as you once very forcibly remarked."</p>

<p>"It does, indeed, sir."</p>

<p>"We have only to keep up our spirits, Ab, go ahead; the
world is large, if it is full of changes."</p>

<p>"True, sir, very true. I was about to remark, Mr. Smith&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Ab."</p>

<p>"That we have known one another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, I think!"</p>

<p>"A long time, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ab."</p>

<p>"And when I was up and you down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, go on."</p>

<p>"I gave you a chance to keep your head above water."</p>

<p>"True enough, Ab, my boy."</p>

<p>"Now, sir, I want you to give me charge of the bar
again, and I'll off coat and go to work like a Trojan."</p>

<p>"Ab Hart," said Smith, "when you came to me, you
was so green you could hardly tell a crossed quarter from
a bogus pistareen&mdash;the 'run of the till' you learnt in a
week, while in less than a month you was the best hand at
'knocking down' I ever met! There's fifty dollars, you
and I are square; we will keep so&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>Poor Absalom was beat at his own game, and soon left
for parts unknown.</p>

Every body snubbed him, and every body wanted to lick him.

<h2><a name="Whiffletrees_Dental_Experience" id="Whiffletrees_Dental_Experience"></a>Bill Whiffletree's Dental Experience.</h2>


<p>Have you ever had the tooth-ache? If not, then
blessed is your ignorance, for it is indeed bliss to
know nothing about the tooth-ache, as you know nothing,
absolutely nothing about pain&mdash;the acute, double-distilled,
rectified agony that lurks about the roots or fangs of a treacherous
tooth. But ask a sufferer how it feels, what it is like,
how it operates, and you may learn something theoretically
which you may pray heaven that you may not know practically.</p>

<p>But there's poor William Whiffletree&mdash;he's been through
the mill, fought, bled, and died (slightly) with the refined,
essential oil of the agony caused by a raging tooth. Every
time we read <i>Othello</i>, we are half inclined to think that
<i>more</i> than half of Iago's devilishness came from that "raging
tooth," which would not let him sleep, but tortured and
tormented "mine ancient" so that he became embittered
against all the world, and blackamoors in particular.</p>

<p>William Whiffletree's case is a very strong illustration
of what tooth-ache is, and what it causes people to do;
and affords a pretty fair idea of the manner in which the
tooth and sufferer are medicinally and morally treated by
the <i>materia medica</i>, and friends at large.</p>

<p>William Whiffletree&mdash;or "Bill," as most people called
him&mdash;was a sturdy young fellow of two-and-twenty, of
"poor but respectable parents," and 'tended the dry-goods
store of one Ethan Rakestraw, in the village of Rockbottom,
State of New York.</p>

<p>One unfortunate day, for poor Bill, there came to Rockbottom
a galvanized-looking individual, rejoicing in the
euphonium of Dr. Hannibal Orestes Wangbanger. As a
surgeon, he had&mdash;according to the album-full of <i>certificates</i>&mdash;operated
in all the scientific branches of amputation,
from the scalp-lock to the heel-tap, upon Emperors, Kings,
Queens, and common folks; but upon his science in the
dental way, he spread and grew luminous! In short, Dr.
Wangbanger had not been long in Rockbottom before his
"gift of gab," and unadulterated propensity to elongate
the blanket, set every body, including poor Bill Whiffletree,
in a furor to have their teeth cut, filed, scraped, rasped, reset,
dug out, and burnished up!</p>

<p>Now Bill, being, as we aforestated, a muscularly-developed
youth, got up in the most sturdy New Hampshire
style, <i>his</i> teeth <i>were</i> teeth, in every way calculated to perform
long and strong; but Bill was fast imbibing counter-jumper
notions, dabbling in stiff dickeys, greased soap-locks,
and other fancy "flab-dabs," supposed to be essential
in cutting a swarth among ye fair sex.</p>

<p>So that when Dr. Wangbanger once had an audience
with Mr. William Whiffletree in regard to one of Mr.
Whiffletree's molars which Bill thought had a "speck" on
it, he soon convinced the victim that the said molar not only
was specked, but out of the dead plumb of its nearest
neighbor at least the 84th part of an inch!</p>

<p>"O, shocking!" says the remorseless <i>hum</i>; "it is well
I saw it in time, Mr. Whiffletree. Why, in the course of a
few weeks, that tooth, sir, would have exfoliated, calcareous
supperation would have ensued, the gum would have ossified,
while the nerve of the tooth becoming apostrophized,
the roots would have concatenated in their hiatuses, and the
jaw-bone, no longer acting upon their fossil exoduses,
would necessarily have led to the entire suspension of the
capillary organs of your stomach and brain, and&mdash;<i>death
would supervene in two hours!</i>"</p>

<p><a name='Pg_092' id='Pg_092'></a>Poor Bill! he scarcely knew what fainting was, but a
queer sensation settled in his "ossis frontis," while his ossis
legso almost bent double under him, at the awful prospect
of things before him! He took a long breath, however,
and in a voice tremulous with emotion, inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Doctor! what's to be done for a feller?"</p>

<p>"Plug and file," calmly said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Plug and file what?"</p>

<p>"The second molar," said the Doctor; though the
treacherous monster <i>meant</i> Bill's wallet, of course!</p>

<p>"What'll it cost, Doctor?" says Bill.</p>

<p>"Done in my very best manner, upon the new and
splendid system invented by myself, sir, and practiced upon
all the crowned heads of Europe, London, and Washington
City, it will cost you three dollars."</p>

<p>"Does it hurt much, Doctor?" was Bill's cautious inquiry.</p>

<p>"Very little, indeed; it's sometimes rather agreeable,
sir, than otherwise," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Then go at it, Doctor! Here's the <i>dosh</i>," and forking
over three dollars, down sits William Whiffletree in a high-backed
chair, and the Doctor's assistant&mdash;a sturdy young
Irishman&mdash;clamping Bill's head to the back of the chair,
to keep it steady, as the Doctor remarked, the latter began
to "bore and file."</p>

<p>"O! ah! ho-ho-hold on, <i>hold on!</i>" cries Bill, at the first
<i>gouge</i> the Doctor gave the huge tooth.</p>

<p>"O! be me soul! be aizy, zur," says the Irishman, "it's
mesilf as untherstands it&mdash;<i>I'll howld on till yees!</i>"</p>

<p>"O&mdash;O-h-h-h!" roars Bill, as the Doctor proceeds.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, sir; the pain won't signify!" says the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Go-goo-good Lord-d-d! Ho-ho-hol-hold on!"</p>

<p>"O, yeez needn't be afeared of that&mdash;I'm howldin' yeez
tight as a divil!" cries Paddy, and sure enough he <i>was</i>
holding, for in vain Bill screwed and twisted and squirmed
around; Pat held him like a cider-press.</p>

</div>

<p>"Let me&mdash;me&mdash;O&mdash;O&mdash;O! Everlasting creation! let
me go-o-o&mdash;stop, <i>hold on-n-n!</i>" as the Doctor bored,
screwed, and plugged away at the tooth.</p>

<p>"All done, sir; let the patient up, Michael," says the
Doctor, with a confident twirl of his perfumed handkerchief.
"There, sir&mdash;there was science, art, elegance, and
dispatch! Now, sir, your tooth is safe&mdash;your life is safe&mdash;<i>you're
a sound man!</i>"</p>

<p>"Sound?" echoes poor Bill, "sound? Why, you've
broken my jaw into flinders; you've set all my teeth on
edge; and I've no more feelin'&mdash;gall darn ye!&mdash;in my
jaws, than if they were iron steel-traps! You've got the
wuth of your money out of my mouth, and I'm off!"</p>

<p>That night was one of anxiety and misery to William
Whiffletree. The disturbed <i>molar</i> growled and twitched
like mad; and, by daylight, poor Bill's cheek was swollen
up equal to a printer's buff-ball, his mouth puckered, and
his right eye half "bunged up."</p>

<p>"Why, William," says Ethan Rakestraw, as Bill went
into the store, "what in grace ails thy face? Thee looks
like an owl in an ivy-bush!"</p>

<p>"Been plugged and filed," says Bill, looking cross as a
meat-axe at his snickering Orthodox boss.</p>

<p>"Plugged and <i>fined</i>? Thee hain't been fighting, William?"</p>

<p>"Fined? No, I ain't been <i>fined</i> or fighting, Mr. Rakestraw,
but I bet I do fight that feller who gave me the
tooth-ache!&mdash;O! O!" moaned poor Bill, as he clamped
his swollen jaw with his hand, and went around waving his
head like a plaster-of-paris mandarin.</p>

<p>"O! thee's been to the dentist, eh? Got the tooth-ache?
Go thee to my wife; she'll cure thee in one minute,
William; a little laudanum and cotton will soon ease thy pain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rakestraw applied the laudanum to Bill's molar,
but as it did no kind of good, old grandmother proposed a
poultice; and soon poor Bill's head and cheek were done up
in mush, while he groaned and grunted and started for the
store, every body gaping at his swollen countenance as
though he was a rare curiosity.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Bill!" says old Firelock, the gunsmith, as Bill
was going by his shop; "got a bag in your calabash, or
got the tooth-ache?"</p>

<p>Bill looked daggers at old Firelock, and by a nod of his
head intimated the cause of his distress.</p>

<p>"O, that all? Come in; I'll stop it in a minute and a
half; sit down, I'll fix it&mdash;I've cured hundreds," says Firelock.</p>

<p>"What are you&mdash;O-h-h, dear! what are you going to
do?" says Bill, eyeing the wire, and lamp in which Firelock
was heating the wire.</p>

<p>"Burn out the marrow of the tooth&mdash;'twill never trouble
you again&mdash;I've cured hundreds that way! Don't be afeared&mdash;you
won't feel it but a moment. Sit still, keep cool!"
says Firelock.</p>

<p>"Cool?" with a hot wire in his tooth! But Bill, being
already intensely crucified, and assured of Firelock's skill,
took his head out of the mush-plaster, opened his jaws, and
Firelock, admonishing him to "keep cool," crowded the
hot, sizzling wire on to the tin foil jammed into the hollow
by Wangbanger, and gave it a twist clear through the
melted tin to the exposed nerve. Bill jumped, bit off the
wire, burnt his tongue, and knocked Firelock nearly
through the partition of his shop; and so frightened Monsieur
Savon, the little barber next door, that he rushed out
into the street, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! Ze zundair strike my shop!"</p>

<p>Bill was stone dead&mdash;Firelock crippled. The apothecary
over the way came in, picked up poor Bill, applied some
camphor to his nose, and brought him back to life, and&mdash;the
pangs of tooth-ache!</p>

<p>"Kreasote!" says Squills, the 'pothecary. "I'll ease
your pain, Mr. Whiffletree, in a second!"</p>

<p>Poor Bill gave up&mdash;the kreasote added a fresh invoice to
his misery&mdash;burnt his already lacerated and roasted tongue&mdash;and
he yelled right out.</p>

<p>"Death and glory! O-h-h-h-h, murder! You've pizened me!"</p>

<p>"Put a hot brick to that young man's face," said a
stranger; "'twill take out the pain and swelling in three minutes!"</p>

<p>Bill revived; he seemed pleased at the stranger's suggestion;
the Brick was applied; but Bill's cheek being now
half raw with the various messes, it made him yell when
the brick touched him!</p>

<p>He cleared for home, went to bed, and the excessive pain,
finally, with laudanum, kreasote, fire, and hot bricks, put
him to sleep.</p>

<p>He awoke at midnight, in a frightful state of misery;
walked the floor until daylight; was tempted two or three
times to jump out the window or crawl up the chimney!</p>

<p>Until noon next day he suffered, trying in vain, every ten
minutes, some "known cure," oils, acids, steam, poultices,
and the ten thousand applications usually tried to
cure a raging tooth.</p>

<p>Desperation made Bill revengeful. He got a club and
went after Dr. Wangbanger, who had set all the village in
a rage of tooth-ache. Ten or a dozen of his victims were
at his door, awaiting ferociously their turns to be revenged.</p>

<p>But the bird had flown; the <i>teuth-doctor</i> had sloped; yet
a good Samaritan came to poor Bill, and whispering in his
ear, Bill started for Monsieur Savon's barber-shop, took a
seat, shut his eyes, and said his prayers. The little Frenchman
took a keen knife and pair of pincers, and Bill giving
one awful yell, the tooth was out, and his pains and perils
at an end!</p>

<h2><a name="A-a-a-int_they_Thick" id="A-a-a-int_they_Thick"></a>A-a-a-in't they Thick?</h2>


<p>During the "great excitement" in Boston, relative
to the fugitive slave "fizzle," a good-natured country
gentleman, by the name of Abner Phipps; an humble
artisan in the fashioning of buckets, wash-tubs and wooden-ware
generally, from one of the remote towns of the good
old Bay State, paid his annual visit to the metropolis of
Yankee land. In the multifarious operations of his shop
and business, Abner had but little time, and as little inclination,
to keep the run of <i>latest news</i>, as set forth glaringly,
every day, under the caption of <i>Telegraphic Dispatches</i>, in
the papers; hence, it requires but a slight extension of
the imagination to apprise you, "dear reader," that our
friend Phipps was but meagerly "posted up" in what was
going on in this great country, half of his time. I must
do friend Phipps the favor to say, that he was not ignorant
of the fact that "Old Hickory" fout well down to New
Orleans, and that "Old Zack" flaxed the Mexicans clean
out of their boots in Mexico; likewise that Millerism was a
humbug, and money was pretty generally considered a cash
article all over the universal world.</p>

<p>But what did Phipps know or care about the Fugitive
Slave bill? Not a red cent's worth, no more than he did
of the equitation of the earth, the Wilmot proviso, or
Barnum's woolly horse&mdash;not a <i>red</i>. He came to Boston annually
to see how things were a workin'; pleasure, not business.
The very first morning of his arrival in town, the
hue and cry of "slave hunters," was raised&mdash;Shadrack, the
fugitive, was arrested at his vocation&mdash;table servant at
Taft's eating establishment, Corn Hill, where Abner Phipps
accidentally had stuck his boots under the mahogany, for
the purpose of recuperating his somewhat exhausted inner-man.
Abner saw the arrest, he was quietly discussing his
<i>tapioca</i>, and if thinking at all, was merely calculating what
the profits were, upon a two-and-sixpence dinner, at a Boston
<i>restaurateur</i>. He saw there was a muss between the
black waiter and two red-nosed white men, but as he did
not know what it was all about, he didn't care; it was none
of his business; and being a part of his religion, not to
meddle with that that did not concern him, he continued
his <i>tapioca</i> to the bottom of his plate, then forked over the
equivalent and stepped out.</p>

<p>As Phipps turned into Court square, it occurred, slightly,
that the niggers had got to be rather thick in Boston, to
what they used to be; and bending his footsteps down
Brattle street, once or twice it occurred to him that the
niggers <i>had</i> got to be thick&mdash;darn'd thick, for they passed
and repassed him&mdash;walked before him and behind him, and
in fact all around him.</p>

<p>"Yes," says Phipps, "the niggers are thick, thundering
thick&mdash;never saw 'em so thick in my life. <i>Ain't they thick?</i>"
he soliloquized, and as he continued his stroll in the purlieus
of "slightly soiled" garments, vulgarly known as
second-hand shops, mostly proprietorized by very dignified
and respectable <i>col'ud pussons</i>, it again struck Phipps
quite forcibly that the niggers were <i>a</i> getting thick.</p>

<p>"Godfree! but ain't they thick! I hope to be stabbed
with a gridiron," said Phipps, "if there ain't more <i>niggers</i>&mdash;look
at 'em&mdash;more niggers than would patch and
grade the infernal regions eleven miles! Guess I've enough
niggers for a spell," continued Phipps, "so I'll just pop
in here, and see how this feller sells his notions." And so
Abner, having reached Dock square, saunters into a gun,
pistol, bowie, jack-knife, dog-collar, shot-bag, and notion-shop
in general. Unlucky step.</p>

<p>The stiff-dickied, frizzle-headed, polished and perfumed
shop-keeper was on hand, and particularly predisposed to sell
the stranger something. Just then a nigger passed the door,
and looked in very sharply at Phipps, and presently two
more passed, then a fourth and fifth, all <i>looking</i> more or
less pointedly at the manufacturer of wooden doin's, and
white-pine fixin's.</p>

<p>"That's a neat <i>collar</i>," says the shop-keeper, as Phipps,
sort of miscellaneously, placed his hand upon a brass-band,
red-lined dog-collar.</p>

<p>"Collar! don't call that a <i>collar</i>, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir, a beautiful collar, sir."</p>

<p>"What for, <i>solgers</i>?" asks Phipps.</p>

<p>"Soldiers, no, dogs," says the shop-keeper, puckering
his mouth as though he had <i>sampled</i> a lemon.</p>

<p>"<i>O!</i>" says Phipps, suddenly realizing the fact. "I ain't
got no dogs; bad stock; don't pay; tax 'em up where I
live; wouldn't pay tax for forty dogs." More niggers
passed, repassed, and looked in at Phipps and the storekeeper.</p>

<p>"I say, ain't the niggers got to be thick&mdash;infernal thick,
in your town lately?"</p>

<p>"Well, I <ins title="dont">don't</ins> know that they are," replied the shop-keeper;
"getting rather scarce, I think, since the Fugitive
bill has been put in force over the country, sir, but it does
appear to me," said the shop-keeper, twiging sundry and suspicious-looking
col'ud gem'en passing by his store, gaping in
rather wistfully at the door, and peeping through the sash
of the windows&mdash;"it does appear to me, that a good many
colored persons are about this morning; yes, there is, why
there goes more, more yet; bless me, there's another, two,
three, four, why a dozen has just passed; they seem to look
in here rather curiously, I wonder&mdash;only look; what has
stirred them up, I want to know!" the fluctuation of the
<i>Congo</i> market completely attracted the handsome man's
<a name='Pg_099' id='Pg_099'></a>
attention; his surprise finally assumed the most tangible
shape and complexion of fear, for the niggers, one and all,
looked savage as meat-axes, and began to get too numerous to mention.</p>

<p class='caption'>"What dat! got pistils in your pocket, eh?" says one of
two big buck Niggers, shying up alongside of the new velocipeding
up-country artisan. "What dat! got de hand-cuffs in he pocket!"&mdash;<a href="#Pg_099"><i>Page</i> 99.</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Well, guess I'll be goin'," says Phipps, after fumbling
over some of the shooting-irons, jack-knives, etc.; reaching
the street, he was more fully impressed with the fixed fact,
that the niggers were all sorts of thick. They fairly
crowded him; one buck darkey rubbed slap up against
Phipps, as he moved out of the store. "Look here, Mister,"
says Phipps, "ain't all this street big enough for you without
a crowdin' me?"</p>

<p>The nigger stopped, looked arsenic and chain lightning
at Phipps, and then moved off, saying in a sort of undertone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gorra, I guess you'll be crowded a wus'n dat afore dis
day is ober."</p>

<p>"Will, eh?" responded Abner Phipps, slightly mystified
as to the why and wherefore, that <i>he</i> should, in particular,
be "crowded," especially by an Ethiopic gentleman.</p>

<p>"I guess I <i>won't</i> then," resumed Phipps; "if any body
ventures to crowd me, just a purpose, I guess I'll be darn'd
apt, and mighty quick to squash in their heads, or whoop'm
on the spot."</p>

<p>"What dat? got pistils in your pocket, eh?" says one
of the two big buck niggers, shying up alongside of the
now <ins title="veloscipeding">velocipeding</ins> up-country artisan. Phipps looked back,
the negroes were following him. "Pistils? <ins title="who'se">who's</ins> talkin'
about pistils, mister?" he ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"Dat's him, watch'm."</p>

<p>"Why, we see'd you goin' in dar, dat pistol shop; want
to lay in a stock of dirks and pistils, eh?" says the negro.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you got any hand-cuffs in you' pocket?" inquired another.</p>

<p>"What dat? got de hand-cuffs in he pocket?"</p>

<p>"Pistils and bowie knibes!" says a third.</p>

<p>"Dat's him! watch'm!"</p>

<p>"Knock'm down, put dat white hat ober his eyes! Hoo-r-r!"</p>

<p>The negroes now fairly beset our victimized friend
Phipps; he stopped, buttoned his coat, the negroes augmented;
glared at him like demons; he fixed his hat firmly
upon his head; the negroes began to grin and move upon
him; he spat upon his hands; the negroes began to yell,
and to close in upon him; with one grand effort, one mighty
gathering of all the human faculties called into action by
fear and desperation, Phipps bounded like a Louisiana bull
at a gate post; he knocked down two, <i>square</i>; kicked over
four, and rushing through the now very considerable and
formidable array of ebony, he <i>broke</i> equal to a wild turkey
through a corn bottom, or a sharp knife through a pound
of milky butter; and it is very questionable whether Phipps
ever stopped running until his boots <i>busted</i>, or he reached
his bucket factory on Taunton river. His negro deputation
<i>waited on him</i> with a rush clear outside of town, where the
speed and bottom of Abner distanced the entire committee.
The key to this joke is: Phipps was dogged from Tafts'&mdash;by
the "vigilant committee," as an informer, or slave-hunter
at least, and hence the delicate attentions of the col'ud
pop'lation paid him. I have no doubt, that if Abner Phipps
be asked, how things look around Boston, he would observe
with some energy,</p>

<p>"Niggers&mdash;niggers are thick&mdash;Godfree! <i>a-a-a-in't they thick!</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="A_Desperate_Race" id="A_Desperate_Race"></a>A Desperate Race.</h2>


<p>Some years ago, I was one of a convivial party, that
met in the principal hotel in the town of Columbus,
Ohio, the seat of government of the Buckeye State.</p>

<p>It was a winter evening when all without was bleak and
stormy, and all within were blythe and gay; when song and
story made the circuit of the festive board, filling up the
chasms of life with mirth and laughter.</p>

<p>We had met for the express purpose of making a night
of it, and the pious intention was duly and most religiously
carried out. The Legislature was in session in
that town, and not a few of the worthy legislators were
present upon this occasion.</p>

<p>One of these worthies I will name, as he not only took a
big swath in the evening's entertainment, but he was a man
<i>more</i> generally known than our worthy President, James
K. Polk. That man was the famous Captain Riley! whose
"narrative" of suffering and adventures is pretty generally
known, all over the civilized world. Captain Riley was a
fine, fat, good-humored joker, who at the period of my
story was the representative of the Dayton district, and
lived near that little city when at home. Well, Captain
Riley had amused the company with many of his far-famed
and singular adventures, which being mostly told before
and read by millions of people, that have ever seen his
book, I will not attempt to repeat them.</p>

<p>Many were the stories and adventures told by the company,
when it came to the turn of a well known gentleman
who represented the Cincinnati district. As Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is yet
among the living, and perhaps not disposed to be the subject
of joke or story, I do not feel at liberty to give his name.
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was a slow believer of other men's adventures, and
at the same time much disposed to magnify himself
into a marvellous hero whenever the opportunity offered.
As Captain Riley wound up one of his truthful, though
really marvellous adventures, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; coolly remarked,
that the captain's story was all very <i>well</i>, but it did not
begin to compare with an adventure that he had "once
upon a time" on the Ohio, below the present city of Cincinnati.</p>

<p>"Let's have it!" "Let's have it!" resounded from all hands.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the Senator, clearing his voice
for action and knocking the ashes from his cigar against
the arm of his chair. "Gentlemen, I am not in the habit of
spinning yarns of marvellous or fictitious matters; and therefore
it is scarcely necessary to affirm upon the responsibility
of my reputation, gentlemen, that what I am about to
tell you, I most solemnly proclaim to be truth, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! never mind that, go on, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," chimed the party.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, in 18&mdash; I came down the Ohio river,
and settled at Losanti, now called Cincinnati. It was, at
that time, but a little settlement of some twenty or thirty
log and frame cabins, and where now stands the Broadway
Hotel and blocks of stores and dwelling houses, was the
cottage and corn patch of old Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, a tailor, who, by
the by, bought that land for the making of a coat for one
of the settlers. Well, I put up my cabin, with the aid of
my neighbors, and put in a patch of corn and potatoes,
about where the Fly Market now stands, and set about
improving my lot, house, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Occasionally, I took up my rifle, and started off with my
dog down the river, to look up a little deer, or <i>bar</i> meat,
then very plenty along the river. The blasted red skins
were lurking about, and hovering around the settlement,
and every once in a while picked off some of our neighbors,
or stole our cattle or horses. I hated the red
demons, and made no bones of peppering the blasted
sarpents whenever I got a sight at them. In fact, the red
rascals had a dread of me, and had laid a great many traps
to get my scalp, but I wasn't to be catch'd napping. No,
no, gentlemen, I was too well up to 'em for that.</p>

<p>"Well, I started off one morning, pretty early, to take
a hunt, and travelled a long way down the river, over the
bottoms and hills, but couldn't find no <i>bar</i> nor deer. About
four o'clock in the afternoon, I made tracks for the settlement
again. By and by, I sees a buck just ahead of me,
walking leisurely down the river. I slipped up, with my
faithful old dog close in my rear, to within clever shooting
distance, and just as the buck stuck his nose in the drink,
I drew a <i>bead</i> upon his top-knot and over he tumbled, and
splurged and bounded awhile, when I came up and relieved
him by cutting his wizen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, but what had that to do with an <i>adventure</i>?" said Riley.</p>

<p>"Hold on a bit, if you please, gentlemen&mdash;by Jove it
had a great deal to do with it. For while I was busy skinning
the hind quarters of the buck, and stowing away the
kidney-fat in my hunting shirt, I heard a noise like the breaking
of brush under a moccasin up 'the bottom.' My dog
heard it and started up to reconnoitre, and I lost no time
in reloading my rifle. I had hardly got my priming out
before my dog raised a howl and broke through the brush
towards me with his tail down, as he was not used to doing
unless there were wolves, painters (panthers) or Injins about.</p>

<p>"I picked up my knife, and took up my line of march in
a skulking trot up the river. The frequent gullies, on the
lower bank, made it tedious travelling there, so I scrabbled
up to the upper bank, which was pretty well covered with
buckeye and sycamore and very little under-brush. One
peep below discovered to me three as big and strapping red
rascals, gentlemen, as you ever clapt your eyes on! Yes,
there they came, not above six hundred yards in my rear.
Shouting and yelling like hounds, and coming after me like
all possessed."</p>

<p>"Well," said an old woodsman sitting at the table,
"you took a tree of course?"</p>

<p>"Did I? No, gentlemen! I took no tree just then,
but I took to my heels like sixty, and it was just as much
as my old dog could do to keep up with me. I run until
the whoops of my red skins grew fainter and fainter behind
me; and clean out of wind, I ventured to look behind me,
and there came one single red whelp, puffing and blowing,
not three hundred yards in my rear. He had got on to a
piece of bottom where the trees were small and scarce&mdash;now,
thinks I, old fellow, I'll have you. So I trotted off
at a pace sufficient to let my follower gain on me, and
when he had got just about near enough, I wheeled and
fired, and down I brought him, dead as a door nail, at a
hundred and twenty yards!"</p>

<p>"Then you skelp'd (scalped) him immediately?" said the backwoodsman.</p>

<p>"Very clear of it, gentlemen, for by the time I got my
rifle loaded, here came the other two red skins, shouting
and whooping close on me, and away I broke again like a
quarter horse. I was now about five miles from the settlement,
and it was getting towards sunset; I ran till my wind
began to be pretty short, when I took a look back and
there they came snorting like mad buffaloes, one about
two or three hundred yards ahead of the other, so I
acted possum again until the foremost Injin got pretty
well up, and I wheeled and fired at the very moment he was
'drawing a <i>bead</i>' on me; he fell head over stomach into
the dirt, and up came the last one!"</p>

<p>"So you laid for him and&mdash;" gasped several.</p>

<p>"No," continued the "member," "I didn't lay for him,
I hadn't time to load, so I layed <i>legs</i> to ground, and
started again. I heard every bound he made after me. I
ran and ran, until the fire flew out of my eyes, and the old
dog's tongue hung out of his mouth a quarter of a yard long!"</p>

<p>"Phe-e-e-e-w!" whistled somebody.</p>

<p>"Fact! gentlemen. Well, what I was to do I didn't
know&mdash;rifle empty, no big trees about, and a murdering red
Indian not three hundred yards in my rear; and, what was
worse, just then it occurred to me that I was not a great
ways from a big creek, (now called Mill Creek,) and there
I should be pinned at last.</p>

<p>"Just at this juncture I struck my toe against a root,
and down I tumbled, and my old dog over me. Before I
could scrabble up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Indian fired!" gasped the old woodsman.</p>

<p>"He did, gentlemen, and I felt the ball strike me under
the shoulder; but that didn't seem to put any embargo upon
my locomotion, for as soon as I got up I took off again,
quite freshened by my fall! I heard the red skin close behind
me coming booming on, and every minute I expected
to have his tomahawk dashed into my head or shoulders.</p>

<p>"Something kind of cool began to trickle down my legs
into my boots&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blood, eh? for the shot the varmint gin you," said the
old woodsman, in a great state of excitement.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the Senator, "but what do you
think it was?"</p>

<p>Not being blood, we were all puzzled to know what the
blazes it could be. When Riley observed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose you had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Melted the deer fat which I had stuck in the breast of
my hunting shirt, and the grease was running down my legs
until my feet got so greasy that my heavy boots flew off,
and one hitting the dog, nearly knocked his brains out."</p>

<p>We all grinned, which the "member" noticing, observed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope, gentlemen, no man here will presume to think
I'm exaggerating?"</p>

<p>"O, certainly not! Go on, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," we all chimed in.</p>

<p>"Well, the ground under my feet was soft, and being
relieved of my heavy boots, I put off with double quick
time, and seeing the creek about half a mile off, I ventured
to look over my shoulder to see what kind of a chance
there was to hold up and load. The red skin was coming
jogging along pretty well blowed out, about five hundred
yards in the rear. Thinks I, here goes to load any how.
So at it I went&mdash;in went the powder, and putting on my
patch, down went the ball about half-way, and off snapped
my ramrod!"</p>

<p>"Thunder and lightning!" shouted the old woodsman,
who was worked up to the top-notch in the "member's" story.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! wasn't I in a pickle! There was the
red whelp within two hundred yards of me, pacing along
and <i>loading up his rifle as he came!</i> I jerked out the
broken ramrod, dashed it away and started on, priming up
as I cantered off, determined to turn and give the red skin
a blast any how, as soon as I reached the creek.</p>

<p>"I was now within a hundred yards of the creek, could
see the smoke from the settlement chimneys; a few more
jumps and I was by the creek. The Indian was close upon
me&mdash;he gave a whoop, and I raised my rifle; on he came,
knowing that I had broken my ramrod and my load not
down; another whoop! whoop! and he was within fifty
yards of me! I pulled trigger, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And killed <i>him</i>?" chuckled Riley.</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir!</i> I missed fire!"</p>

<p>"And the red skin&mdash;" shouted the old woodsman in a
phrenzy of excitement&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Fired and killed me!</i>"</p>

<p>The screams and shouts that followed this finale brought
landlord Noble, servants and hostlers, running up stairs to
see if the house was on fire!</p>

<i>Mot</i> is the name given small clumps of trees or woods,
found scattered over the prairie land of Texas.</p>
</div>

<p>We had started from camp about sunrise, to hunt, three
of us; one, an old hunter, who, after marking out our
course, giving us the lay of the land, and various admonitions
as to the danger of getting too far from camp, looking
out for "Injin signs," &amp;c., "Old Traps," as we called him,
took a tour southward, and left us. Myself and companion
were each armed with rifles; his a blunt "Yeager," by the
way, and mine an Ohio piece, carrying about one hundred
and twenty balls to the pound, consequently very light, and
not a very sure thing for a distance over one hundred yards.
It was in the fall of the year, delightful weather: our wardrobe
consisted of Kentucky jean trousers, boots, straw hats,
two shirts, and jean hunting shirts&mdash;all thin, to be sure, but
warm and comfortable enough for a day's hunt. We
trudged about until noon, firing but once, and then at an
alligator in a <i>bayou</i>, whose coat of mail laughed to scorn
our puny bullets, and, barely flirting his horny tail in contempt,
he slid from his perch back into the greasy and turbid
stream. Seating ourselves upon a dead cotton-wood,
we made a slight repast upon some cold <i>pone</i>, which, moistened
with a drop of "Mon'galy," proved, I must needs
confess, upon such occasions, viands as palatable as a Tremont
dinner to a city gourmand. While thus quietly disposed,
all of a sudden we heard a racket in our rear, which,
though it startled us at first, soon apprised us that game
was at hand. Dropping low, we soon saw, a few yards
above us, the large antlers of a buck. He darted down
the slight bluffs, followed by a doe and two well-grown fawns.</p>

<p>As they gained the water, and but barely stuck their
noses into the drink, we both let drive at them: but, in
my rising upon my knee to fire at the buck, he got wind of
the courtesies I was about to tender him, and absolutely
dodged my ball. I was too close to miss him; but, as he
"juked"&mdash;to use an old-fashioned western word&mdash;down his
head the moment he saw fire, the bullet merely made the
fur fly down his neck, and, with a back bound or double
somerset, he scooted quicker than uncorked thunder.</p>

<p>Our eyes met&mdash;we both grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, by King," says my friend Mat, "that's shooting!"</p>

<p>"Both missed?" says I.</p>

<p>"Better break for camp, straight: if we should meet a
greaser or Camanche here, they'd take our scalps, and beat
us about the jaws with 'em!"</p>

<p>It was thought to bear the complexion of a joke, and we
both laughed quite jocosely at it.</p>

<p>"Now," says I, "old Sweetener," loading up my rifle,
"you and I can't give it up so, no how." Tripping up a
cup of the alligator fluid, we washed down our crumbs, and
started. We followed the deer about two miles up the
<i>bayou</i>; the land was low prairie bottom, ugly for walking,
and our track was slow and tedious. But, approaching a
suspicious place carefully and cautiously, we had another
fair view of the doe and fawns, feeding and watching on the
side of a broad prairie. The distance between us was
quite extensive; we could not well approach within shooting
distance without alarming them. The only alternative
was for my friend Mat to deposit himself among the brush
and stuff, and let me circumvent the critters; one of us
would surely get a whack at them. I started; a slow, tedious
scratch and crawl of nearly a mile got me to the windward
of the deer. As I edged down along the high grass
and chapperel, about a branch of the <i>bayou</i>, the old doe
began to raise her head occasionally, and scent the air:
this, as I got still nearer, she repeated more frequently,
until, at length, she took the hint, and made a break down
towards my friend Mat, who, sharp upon the trigger, just
as the three deer got within fifty yards, raised and fired.
'Bout went the deer, making a dash for my quarters; but
before getting any ways near me, down toppled one of the
young 'uns. Mat had fixed its flint; but my blood was up&mdash;I
was not to be fooled out of my shot in that way; and
perceiving my only chance, at best, was to be a long shot,
off hand, as the doe and her remaining fawn dashed by, at
over eighty yards, I let her have the best I had; the bullet
struck&mdash;the old doe jumped, by way of an extra, about five
by thirty feet, and didn't even stop to ask permission at that.
A sportsman undergoes no little excitement in peppering a
few paltry pigeons, a duck or a squirrel, but when an amateur
hunter gets his Ebenezer set on a real deer, bear, or
flock of wild <ins title="turkies">turkeys</ins>, you may safely premise it would take
some capital to buy him off.</p>

<p>I forgot all about time and space, Mat, "Old Traps,"
greasers and Injins&mdash;my whole capital was invested in the
old <i>doe</i>, and I was after <i>her</i>. She was badly wounded; I
thought she'd "gin eout" pretty soon, and I followed clear
across the prairie. Time flew, and finally, feeling considerably
fagged, and getting no further view of my deer, and
being no longer able to trace the red drops she sprinkled
along, I sat down, wiped the salt water from my parboiled
countenance, and began to&mdash;&mdash; think I'd gone far enough
for old venison. In fact, I'd gone a little too far, for the
sun was setting down to his home in the Pacific, the black
shades of night began to gather around the timber, and I
hurried out into the prairie, to get an observation. But it
was no go. I had entirely reversed the order of things, in
my mind; I had lost my bearings. The evening was
cloudy, with a first rate prospect of a wet night, and neither
moon nor stars were to be seen.</p>

<p>Taking, at a hazard, the supposed back track, across the
broad prairie, upon which flourished a stiff, tall grass, I
plodded along, quite chilly, and my thin garments, wet
from perspiration, were cold as cakes of ice to my flesh.
I began to feel mad, swore some, hoped I was on the right
track back to Mat and his deer, but felt satisfied there was
some doubt about that. Mat had the flint and steel for
raising a fire, and the <i>meat</i> and what bread was left at our
last repast. Night came right down in the midst of my
cares and tribulations. A slight drizzling rain began to
fall. The stillness of a prairie is a damper to the best of
spirits&mdash;the entire suspension of all noises and sounds, not
even the tick of an insect to break the black, dull, dark
monotony, is a wet blanket to cheerfulness. I really think
the stillness of a large prairie is one of the most painful
sensations of loneliness, a man ever encountered. The
sombre and dreary monotony of a dungeon, is scarcely a
comparison; in fact, language fails to describe the essentially
double-distilled monotony of these great American
grass-patches&mdash;you can't call them deserts, for at times they
represent interminable flower-gardens, of the most elegant
and voluptuous description.</p>

<p>Oh, how home and its comforts floated in my mind's eye;
how I envied&mdash;not for the first time either&mdash;the unthankful
inmates of even a second-rate boarding-house! A negro
cabin, a shed, dog kennel, and a hoe cake, had charms, in
my thoughts, just then, enough to exalt them into fit themes
for the poets and painters. Having trudged along, at least
three miles, in one direction, I struck a large <i>mot</i>, that jutted
out into the prairie. Here I concluded it was best to
hang up for the night. I was soaking wet&mdash;hungry and
wolfish enough. My utter desperation induced me to work
for an hour with some percussion caps, powder, and a piece
of greased tow linen, to get a blaze of fire, Ingins or no
Ingins. I began to wish I was a Camanche myself, or that
the red devils would surround me, give me one bite and a
drink, and I'd die happy. All of a sudden, I got sight of
a blaze! Yes, a real fire loomed up in the distance! It
was Mat and his deer, in luck, doing well, while I was cold
as Caucasus, and hollow as a flute. I riz, stretched my stiff
limbs, and struck a bee line for the light. After wading,
stumbling, and tramping, until my weary legs would bear
me no longer, I had the mortification to see the fire at as
great a distance as when I first started. This about knocked
me. I concluded to give up right in my tracks, and let
myself be wet down into <i>papier mache</i> by the descending
elements. Blessed was he that invented sleep, says Sancho
Panza, but he was a better workman that invented <i>spunk</i>.
All of a sudden I plucked up my spunk, and by a sort of
martial command, ordered my limbs to duty, and marched
straight for the fire in the weary distance. A steady and
toilsome perseverance over brake and bush, mud, ravine,
grass and water, at length brought me near the fire. And
then, suspicion arose, if I fell upon a Mexican or Indian
camp, the evils and perils of the night would turn up in the
morning with a human barbecue, and these impressions
were nearly sufficient inducement for me to go no further.
It might be my friend Mat's fire, and it might not be: it
wasn't very likely he would dare to raise a fire, and the
more I debated, the worse complexion things bore. Involuntarily,
however, I edged on up towards the fire, which
was going down apparently. Coming to a <i>bayou</i>, I reconnoitered
some time. All was quiet, save the pattering of
the rain in the grass, and on the scattering lofty trees. I
stood still and absorbed, watching the dying fire, for an
hour or two. I was within half a mile of it; the intense
darkness that usually precedes day had passed, and a
murky, rainy morning was dawning. Cheerless, fatigued,
and hungry beyond all mental supervision or fear, I marched
point blank up to the fire, and there lay&mdash;not a tribe of
Mexicans or Camanches, but my comrade Mat, fast asleep,
under the lee of a huge dead and fallen cotton-wood, alongside
of the fire, warm, dry, and comfortable as a bug in a rug!</p>

<p>I gave one shout, that would have riz the scalp lock of
any red skin within ten miles, and Mat started upon his
feet and snatched his "Yeager" from under the log quicker
than death.</p>

<p>"Ho-o-o-ld yer hoss, stranger," I yelled, "I'm only
going to eat ye!"</p>

<p>Mat and I fraternized, quick and strong. A piece of
his fawn was jerked and roasted in a giffy. After gormandizing
about five pounds, and getting a few whiffs at Mat's
old stone pipe, I took his nest under the log, and slept a
few hours sound as a pig of lead.</p>

<p>Waked up, prime&mdash;stowed away a few more pounds of
the fawn, and then we started for camp. Living and faring
in this manner, for from three to twelve months, may give
you some idea of the training the heroes of San Jacinto had.</p>

<h2><a name="Roosting_Out" id="Roosting_Out"></a>Roosting Out.</h2>


<p>In 1837, after the capture of Santa Anna, by General
Samuel Houston and his little Spartan band, which
event settled the war, and something like tranquillity being
restored to Texas, several of us adventurers formed a small
hunting party, and took to the woods, in a circuitous tour
up and across the Sabine, and so into the United States,
homeward bound.</p>

<p>There were seven men, two black boys, belonging to Dr.
Clenen, one of our "voyageurs," and eleven horses and
mules, in the party; and with a tolerable fair camp equipage,
plenty of ammunition, one or two "old campaigners"
and three monstrous clever dogs, it was naturally supposed
we should have a pleasant time. The first five days
were cold, being early Spring, wet, and not <i>very</i> interesting;
but as all of the party had seen some service, and not
expecting the comforts and delicacies of civilization, they
were all the better prepared to take things as they came,
and by the smooth handle. The idea was to travel slow,
and reach Jonesboro' or Red River, or keep on the Arkansas,
and strike near Fort Smith, in twenty or thirty
days. We left Houston in the morning, passed Montgomery,
and kept on W. by N. between the Rio Brasos and
Trinity River, the first five days, then stood off north for
the head of the Sabine.</p>

<p>Game was very sparse, and rather shy, but falling in
with some wild turkeys, and a bee tree, we laid by two days
and lived like fighting cocks. The turkeys were picked
off the tall trees, as they roosted after night, by rifle shots,
and no game I ever fed on can exceed the rich flavor of a
well-roasted, fat wild turkey. The bee tree was a crowder&mdash;a
large, hollow cyprus, about sixty feet high, straight as
a barber pole, and nearly seven feet in diameter at the base,
and full three feet through at the first branch, forty feet up.
This must have been the hive of many and many a swarm,
for years past; the tree was cut down, and contained from
one to three hundred gallons of honey and comb! Nor are
such bee trees scarce about the head of the Sabine, Red
River, &amp;c. Bears are very fond of honey. The weather
then being much improved, it was suggested that the camp
should be moved a few miles off, and leave the bee tree and
its great surplus contents, to the bears; and if they did
come about, we should come back and have a few pops at
them. The plan was feasible, and all agreed; so, removing
a few gallons of the translucent delicacy, the camp was
struck, and, following an old trail a few miles, we found a
delightful site for recamping under some large oaks on a
creek, a tributary of the Sabine river.</p>

<p>Some of the "boys," as each styled the others, during
the day had found "a deer lick," about three miles above
the camp, and to vary the <i>viands</i> a little, it was proposed
that three of the boys should go up after dark, lay about,
and see if a shot could be had at some of the visitors of "the lick."</p>

<p>One of the old heads, and by-the-way we called him "old
traps," from the fact of his always being so ready to explain
the manner and uses of all sorts of traps, and the
inexhaustible adventures he had with them in the course
of twenty years' experience in the far west.</p>

<p>Well, "old traps," Dr. C., and myself, were the deputed
committee, that night, to attend to the cases of the deer.
Soon after dark we put out, and in the course of a couple
of hours, after some floundering in a muddy "bottom" and
through hazel brush, or chaparral, the "lick" was found,
and positions taken for raking the victims. "Old traps"
took a lodge in a clump of bushes. Dr. C. and I squatted
on a dead tree, with a few bushes around it, and in a particularly
dark spot, from the fact of some very heavy timber
with wide-spreading tops standing around and nearly over us.</p>

<p>The ability of keeping still in a disagreeable situation,
for a long time, is most desirable and necessary in the character
of a hunter;&mdash;some men have a faculty for holding
a fishing-rod hours at a time over a fishless tide, with wondrous
ardor; and I have known men to watch deer, bear,
and other game, in one position, for ten or twenty hours.
Sauntering up and down in the dark, with wind and rain,
and a musket in your arms for company, is not pleasant
pastime; but my patience revolted at the idea of squatting
on the wet log, all cramped up, three or four hours, and no
deer making their appearance; Doctor and I made up our
minds to arouse "old traps," and patter back to the camp.
Just as the resolution was about to be put in action, two
deer, fine antlered customers, made their appearance about
three hundred yards from us, out on a small plain, where
their sprightly forms could just be made out as they leisurely
stepped along. Getting near "old traps," he soon
convinced us that <i>his</i> eye was still open, although we had
concluded he was fast asleep. The sharp, whip-like crack
of "old traps'" rifle brought down one of the deer, and
the other, in bounds of thirty or forty feet at a spring,
whisked nearly over us, and the Doctor and I fired at the
flying deer as he came; neither shot took effect, and off he sped.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! for the old boy!" shouted the Doctor, as we
all bustled up to where the deer lay kicking and plunging
in his death throes. "By Jove, 'traps,' you've put a ball
clean through his head!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said traps; "I ollers fix game that way, myself."</p>

<p>"Except when you fix them with the traps, eh?" said I.</p>

<p>"'Zactly," said traps. "But now, boys," he continued
loading up his rifle, "now let's snatch off the creature's
hide, quarter it, and travel back to the camp, for we ain't
gwoine to have any more deer to-night."</p>

<p>This was soon accomplished. Trap seized the hind quarters
and hide, and travelled; Doctor and I brought up the
rear with the rest of the meat and fat.</p>

<p>To avoid the muddy "bottom," in going back, we concluded
to take a little round-about way, and relieved one
another by taking "spells" at carrying the rifles and the
meat. We jogged along, chatting away, for some time,
when it occurred to us that we were getting very near the
camp, or ought to be, for we had walked long and fast enough.</p>

<p>Doctor was trudging on ahead with the meat; I was
behind some twenty yards with both rifles; we were passing
through some thin timber which skirted a little prairie, out
on which we could see quite distinctly; Doctor made a sudden halt&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hollo! by Jove, what's that?"</p>

<p>"What? eh? where?" said I, bustling up to the Doctor,
who made free to drop the meat, wheeled about,
snatched his rifle out of my fists and <i>broke!</i></p>

<p>"A grizzly bear coming, by thunder!"</p>

<p>Upon that <i>hint</i> there were two gentlemen seen hurrying
themselves <i>somewhat</i>, I reckon, on the back track. Doctor
was what you might call a fast trotter, but when he broke
into a full gallop the odds against me were dreadful! I
was fairly distanced, and when perfectly blowed out stopped
to pull the briars out of my torn trowsers, scratched face
and dishevelled locks, listen to the enemy, and ascertain
where the Doctor had got to. No sound broke the reigning
stillness, save the sonorous "coo-hoot" of an owl. My
rifle was empty, and a search satisfied me that my caps
were not to be found. My own cap had also disappeared
in the fright, and I was in a bad way for defence, and completely
at a dead loss as to the bearings of the camp.</p>

<p>"Well," thinks I, "it's no particular use crying over
spilt milk&mdash;it's no use to move when there is no idea existing
of bettering one's self, so here I'll <i>roost</i> until daylight,
unless Doctor comes back to hunt me up!" I judged it
was not far from 2 o'clock, A. M., and believed it possible
that our venison might only whet a grizzly bear's appetite
to follow up the pursuit and gormandize me!&mdash;A proper
site for a <i>roost</i> was the next matter of importance, and a
scrubby oak with a thick top, close by, offered an inviting
elevation to lodge.</p>

<p>A long, long time seemed the coming day; and the sharp
air of its approach, and heavy dew, made "perching" in a
crotch very fatiguing "pastime."</p>

<p>When light began to dawn, sliding down I took an observation
that convinced me, according to Indian signs, that
Doctor and I had gone South too far to hit the camp, and,
to the best of my reckoning, the old bee tree was not far
out of my way, and that I now struck for.</p>

<p>About noon, and a lovely day it was, I discovered the
bee tree, made a dinner on honey, which was scattered
about considerably, giving evidence of its having been
visited by our rugged Russian friends.</p>

<p>And now, feeling anxious to see human faces, and not
linger about a spot where troublesome customers might
abound, I made tracks for the camp, which was reached
about sundown, and where I found, to my regret, the Doctor
had not come in yet.</p>

<p>"Old Traps" had returned all safe enough, and had been
prophesying "the boys" were lost, and would not soon be
found again. However, the old fellow put away his deer
skin, which he had been cleaning, &amp;c., to give me a feed
of the deer, a few remnants yet remaining, and from my
exercise and fasting, never was a rude meal more luxurious.
Two of the party, with one of the black boys, and a mule,
had been out since noon in quest of us, and about midnight
they returned with the Doctor, who congratulated me on
what he had estimated as an escape. So did I. We all
concluded <i>it was a</i> <span class="smcap">deer</span> <i>hunt!</i> Though we "had a time"
at the bee tree, next night, that made us about square.</p>

<span class='smcap'>A Dinner Sketch</span>.
</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, during a passage from Gotham to
Boston, on the "<i>Empire State</i>," one of the most
elegant and swift steamers that ever man's ingenuity put
upon the waters, I met a well-known joker from the Quaker
city, on his first trip "down East." After mutually examining
and eulogising the external appearance and internal
arrangements of the "Empire," winding up our investigation,
of course, with a <i>look</i> into a small corner cupboard
in the barber's office, where a superb <i>smile</i>&mdash;as <i>is</i> a smile&mdash;can
be usually enjoyed by the <i>nobbish</i> investment of a York
shilling; soon after passing through "Hell Gate"&mdash;gliding
by the beautiful villas, chateaux, and almost princely
palaces of the business men of the great city of New York,
we were soon out upon the broad, deep Sound, a glorious
place for steam-boating. Soon after, the bells announced
"supper ready"&mdash;a general stampede into the spacious
cabin took place, and though the tables strung along forty
rods on each side of the great cabin, not over half the
crowd got seats upon this interesting occasion. I was
<i>about</i> with my friend&mdash;in <i>time</i>, stuck our legs under the
mahogany, and gazed upon the open prospect for a supper
superb enough in all its details to tempt a jolly old friar
from his devotions. We got along very nicely. An old
chap who sat above us some seats, and whose rotund developments
gave any ordinary observer reason to suppose his
appetite as unquenchable as the Maelstrom, kept reaching
about, and when tempting vessels were too remote, he'd
bawl "right eout" for them.</p>

<p>"Halloo! I say you, Mister there, just hand along that
saas; give us a chance, will ye, at that; notion on't, what
d'ye call that stuff?"</p>

<p>"This?" says one, passing along a dish.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, no, t'other there."</p>

<p>"Oh! ah! yes, <i>this</i>," says my facetious friend.</p>

<p>"Well, that ain't it, but no odds; fetch it along!" and
down we sent the biggest dish of meat in our neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Now," says I, "my boy, I'll show you a 'dodge.' We'll
see how it works."</p>

<p>Filling a plate full to the brim, with all and each of the
various <i>heavy</i> courses in our vicinity, I very politely passed
it over to my next neighbor with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please to pass that up, sir?"</p>

<p>"Umph, eh?" says the gentleman, taking hold of the
plate very gingerly; "pass it <i>up</i>?"</p>

<p>"Aye, yes, if you please," says I.</p>

<p>By this time he had fairly got the loaded plate in his
fists, and began to look about him where to pass the plate
<i>to</i>. Nobody in particular seemed on the watch for a <i>spare</i>
plate. The gent looked back at me, but I was "cutting
away" and watching from the extreme corner of my left
eye the victim and his charge, while I pressed hard upon
the corn pile of my friend's foot under the table.</p>

<p>At length, the victim thought he saw some one up the
table waiting for the plate, and quickly he whispered to his
next neighbor&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please, sir, to-to-a, <i>just pass this plate up!</i>"</p>

<p>The man took the plate, and being more of a practical
operator than his neighbor, gave the plate over to <i>his</i> next
neighbor, with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pass this plate up to that gentleman, if you please,"
dodging his head towards an old gent in specs, who sat
near the head of the table, grinning a ghastly smile over
the field of good things.</p>

<p>"It's <i>going!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" says my friend.</p>

<p>"The plate; it's going the rounds; just you keep quiet,
you'll see a good thing."</p>

<p>The plate, at length, got to the head of the table. It
was given to the old gentleman in specs; he looked over
the top of his specs very deliberately at the "fodder," then
back at the thin, pale, student-looking youth who handed
it to him, then up and down the table. A raw-boned,
gaunt and hollow-looking disciple caught the eye of the old
gent; he must be the man who wanted the "load." His
lips quacked as if in the act of&mdash;"pass this plate, sir,"&mdash;to
his next neighbor; he was too far off for us to <i>hear</i> his
discourse. Well, the plate came booming along down the
opposite side; the tall man declined it and gave it over to
his next neighbor, who seemed a little tempted to take hold
of the invoice, but just then it occurred to him, probably,
that he was keeping <i>somebody</i> (!) out of his grub, so he
quickly turned to his neighbor and passed the plate. One
or two more moves brought the plate within our range,
and there it liked to have <i>stuck</i>, for a fussy old Englishman,
in whom politeness did not stick out very prominently, grunted&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't want it, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, but, sir, please <i>pass it</i>," says the last victim, beseechingly
holding out the plate.</p>

<p>"Pass it? Here, mister, 's your plate," says Bull, at
length reluctantly seizing on the plate, and rushing it on
to his next neighbor, who started&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not mine, sir."</p>

<p>"Not yours! Who does it belong to? Pass it down to somebody."</p>

<p>Off went the plate again. Several ladies turned up their
pretty eyes and noses while the gents <i>passed it</i> by them.</p>

<p>"Why, if there ain't that plate a going the rounds, that
you gave me!" says my next neighbor, to whom I had first
given the "currency."</p>

<p>"That plate? Oh, yes, so it is; well," says I, with
feigned astonishment, "this is the first time I ever saw a
good supper so universally discarded!"</p>

<p>The plate was off again. It reached the foot of the
table. An elderly lady looked up, looked around, removed
a large sweet potato from the pile&mdash;then passed it along.
An old salty-looking captain, just then took a vacant seat,
and the plate reached him just in the nick of time. He
looked voracious&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, with a savage growl, "that's your sort;
thunder and oakum, I'm as peckish as a shark, and here's
the <i>duff for me!</i>"</p>

<p>That ended the peregrinations of the plate, and I and
my friend&mdash;<i>yelled right out!</i></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="Leg_of_Mutton" id="Leg_of_Mutton"></a>The Leg of Mutton.</h2>


<p>I'm going to state to you the remarkable adventures of a
very remarkable man, who went to market to get a leg of
mutton for his Sunday dinner. I have heard, or read somewhere
or other, almost similar stories; whether they were
real or imaginary, I am unable to say; but I can vouch for
the authenticity of my story, for I know the hero well.</p>

<p>In the year 1812, it will be recollected that we had some
military disputes with England, which elicited some pretty
tall fights by land and sea, and the land we live in was considerably
excited upon the subject, and patriotism rose to
many degrees above blood heat. Philadelphia, about that
time, like all other cities, I suppose, was the scene of drum-beating,
marching and counter-marching, and volunteering
of the patriotic people.</p>

<p>The President sent forth his proclamations, the governors
of the respective States reiterated them, and a large
portion of our brave republicans were soon in or marching
to the battle field. There lived and wrought at his trade,
carpentering, in the city of Philadelphia, about that time,
a very tall, slim man, named Houp; Peter Houp, that was
his name. He was a very steady, upright, and honest man,
married, had a small, comfortable family, and to all intents
and purposes, settled down for life. How deceptive, how
unstable, how uncertain is man, to say nothing of the more
frail portion of the creation&mdash;woman! Peter Houp one
fair morning took his basket on his arm, and off he went to
get a leg of mutton and trimmings for his next Sunday's
dinner. Beyond the object of research, Peter never dreamed
of extending his travels for that day, certain. A leg of
mutton is not an indifferent article, well cooked, a matter
somewhat different to amateur cooks; and as good legs of
mutton as can be found on this side of the big pond, can
be found almost any Saturday morning in the Pennsylvania
market wagons, which congregate along Second street, for
a mile or two in a string. Peter could have secured his
leg and brought it home in an hour or two at most.</p>

<p>But hours passed, noon came, and night followed it, and
in the course of time, the morrow, the joyous Sunday, for
which the <i>leg of mutton</i> was to be brought and prepared,
and offered up, a sacrifice to the household gods and grateful
appetites, came, but neither the leg of mutton, nor the
man Peter, husband and father Houp, darkened the doors
of the carpenter's humble domicil, that day, the next or the
next! I cannot, of course, realize half the agony or tortures
of suspense that must have preyed upon that wife's
heart and brain, that must have haunted her feverish dreams
at night, and her aching mind by day. When grim death
strikes a blow, whenever so near and dear a friend is levelled,
cold, breathless, dead&mdash;we see, we know there is the
end! Grief has its season, the bitterest of woe then calms,
subsides, or ceases; but <i>lost</i>&mdash;which hope prevents mourning
as dead, and whose death-like absence almost precludes
the idea that they live, engenders in the soul of true affection,
a gloomy, torturing and desponding sorrow, more
agonizing than the sting actual death leaves behind. I have
endeavored to depict what must have been, what were the
feelings of Peter Houp's wife. She mourned and grieved,
and still hoped on, though months and years passed away
without imparting the slightest clue to the unfortunate fate
of her husband. Her three children, two boys and a girl,
grew up; ten, eleven, twelve years passed away, with no tidings
of the lost man having reached his family; but they
still lived with a kind of despairing hope that the husband
and father would yet <i>come home</i>, and so he did.</p>

<p>Let us see what became of Peter Houp, the carpenter.
As he strolled along with his basket under his arm, on the
eventful morning he sought the leg of mutton, he met a
platoon of men dressed up in uniform, muskets on their
shoulders, colors flying, drums beating, and a mob of
hurrahers following and shouting for the volunteers. Yes,
it was a company of volunteers, just about shipping off for
the South, to join the "Old Zack" of that day, General
Jackson. Peter Houp saw in the ranks of the volunteers
several of his old <i>chums</i>; he spoke to them, walked along
with the men of Mars, got inspired&mdash;patriotic&mdash;<i>drunk</i>.
Two days after that eventful Saturday, on which the quiet,
honest, and industrious carpenter left his wife and children
full of hope and happiness, he found himself in blue breeches,
roundabout, and black cap, on board a brig&mdash;bound for
New Orleans. A volunteer for the war! It was too late
to repent then; the brig was ploughing her way through
the foaming billows, and in a few weeks she arrived at Mobile,
as she could not reach New Orleans, the British under
General Packenham being off the Balize. So the volunteers
were landed at Mobile, and hurried on over land to
the devoted (or was to be) Crescent city. Peter Houp was
not only a good man, liable as all men are to make a false
step once in life, but a brave one. Having gone so far,
and made a step so hard to retrace, Peter's cool reason got
bothered; he poured the spirits down to keep his spirits
up, as the saying goes, and abandoned himself to fate.
Caring neither for life nor death, he was found behind the
cotton bags, which he had assisted in getting down from
the city to the battle ground, piled up, and now ready to
defend his country while life lasted. Peter fought well, being
a man not unlike the brave Old Hickory himself, tall,
firm, and resolute-looking. He attracted General Jackson's
attention during the battle, and afterwards was personally
complimented for his skill and courage by the victorious
Commander-in-chief. Every body knows the history of
the battle of New Orleans&mdash;I need not relate it. After the
victory, the soldiers were allowed considerable license, and
they made New Orleans a scene of revel and dissipation, as
all cities are likely to represent when near a victorious
army. Peter Houp was on a "regular bender," a "big
tare," a long spree&mdash;and for one so unlike any thing of the
kind, he went it with a <i>perfect looseness</i>.</p>

<p>A rich citizen's house was robbed&mdash;burglariously entered
and robbed; and Peter Houp, the staid, plain Philadelphia
carpenter, who would not have bartered his reputation
for all the ingots of the Incas, while in his sober senses,
was arrested as one of the burglars, and the imputation,
false or true, caused him to spend seven years in a penitentiary.
O, what an awful probation of sorrow and mental
agony were those seven long years! But they passed
over, and Peter Houp was again free, not a worse man, fortunately,
but a much wiser one! He had not seen or heard
a word of those so long dearly cherished, and cruelly deserted&mdash;his
family&mdash;for eight years, and his heart yearned
towards them so strongly that, pennyless, pale and care-worn
as he was, he would have started immediately for
home, but being a good carpenter, and wages high, he concluded
to go to work, while he patiently awaited a reply of
his abandoned family to his long and penitent written letter.
Weeks, months, and a year passed, and no reply came,
though another letter was dispatched, for fear of the miscarriage
of the first; (and both letters did miscarry, as the
wife never received them.) Peter gave himself up as a lost
man, his family lost or scattered, and nothing but death
could end his detailed wretchedness. But still, as fortune
would have it, he never again sought refuge from his sorrows
in the poisoned chalice, the rum glass; not he. Peter
toiled, saved his money, and at the end of four years found
himself in the possession of a snug little sum of hard cash,
and a fully established good name. But all of this time he
had heard not a syllable of his home; and all of a sudden,
one fine day in early spring, he took passage in a ship, arrived
in Philadelphia; and in a few rods from the wharf,
upon which he landed, he met an old neighbor. The astonishment
of the latter seemed wondrous; he burst out&mdash;</p>

<p>"My God! is this Peter Houp, come from his grave?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peter, in his slow, dry way, "I'm from New Orleans."</p>

<p>Peter soon learned that his wife and children yet lived in
the same place, and long mourned him as forever gone.
Peter Houp felt any thing but merry, but he was determined
to have his joke and a merry meeting. In an hour or two
Peter Houp, the long lost wanderer, stood in his own door.</p>

<p>"Well, Nancy, <i>here is thy leg of mutton!</i>" and a fine
one too he had.</p>

<p>The most excellent woman was alone. She was of Quaker
origin; sober and stoical as her husband, she regarded
him wistfully as he stood in the door, for a long
time; at last she spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Peter, thee's been gone a <i>long time for it</i>."</p>

<p>The next moment found them locked in each other's
arms; overtasked nature could stand no more, and they
both cried like children.</p>

<p>The carpenter has once held offices of public trust, and
lives yet, I believe, an old and highly respected citizen of
"Brotherly Love."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_on_Misers" id="Chapter_on_Misers"></a>A Chapter on Misers.</h2>


<p>We all love, worship and adore that everlasting deity&mdash;<i>money</i>.
The poor feel its want, the rich know
its power. Virtue falls before its corrupting and seductive
influence. Honor is tainted by it. Pride, pomp and
power, are but the creatures of money, and which corrupt
hearts and enslaved souls wield to the great annoyance&mdash;yea,
curse of mankind in general.</p>

<p>It is well, that, though we are all fond of money, not
over one in a thousand, prove miserable misers, and go on
to amass dollar upon dollar, until the shining heaps of garnered
gold and silver become a god, and a faith, that the
rich wretch worships with the tenacious devotion of the
most frenzied fanatic. In the accumulation of a competency,
against the odds and chances of advanced life, a man may
be pardoned for a degree of economical prudence; but for
parsimonious meanness, there is certainly no excuse. I
have heard my father speak of an old miserly fellow, who
owned a great many blocks of buildings in Philadelphia, as
well as many excellent farms around there, and who, though
rich as a Jew (worth $200,000), was so despicably and
scandalously mean, as to go through the markets and beg
bones of the butchers, to make himself and family soup for
their dinners! He resorted to a score of similar humiliating
"dodges," whereby to prolong his miserable existence, and
add dime and dollar to his already bursting coffers.</p>

<p>At length, Death knocked at his door. The debt was
one the poor wretch would fain have gotten a little more
time on, but the Court of Death brooks no delay&mdash;there is
no cunning devise of learned counsel, no writs of error, by
which even a miserable miser, or voluptuous millionaire, can
gain a moment's delay when death issues his summons. The
miser was called for, and he knew his time had come. He
sent for the undertaker, he bargained for his burial&mdash;</p>

<p>"They say I'm rich! it's a lie, sir&mdash;I'm poor, miserably
poor. I want but three carriages. My children may want
a dozen&mdash;I say but <i>three</i>; put that down. A very plain
coffin; pine, stained will do, and no ornaments, hark ye.
A cheap grave. I would be buried on one of my farms,
but then the coach-drivers would charge so much to carry
me out! Now, what will you ask for the job?"</p>

<p>"About thirty dollars, sir," said the almost horrified undertaker.</p>

<p>"Thirty dollars! why, do you want to rob me? Say
fifteen dollars&mdash;give me a receipt&mdash;<i>and I'll pay you the
cash down!</i>"</p>

<p>Poor wretch! by the time he had uttered this, his soul
had flown to its resting-place in another world.</p>

<p>In the upper part of Boston, on what is called "the
Neck," there lived, some years ago, a wealthy old man, who
resorted to sundry curious methods to live without cost to
himself. His house&mdash;one of the handsomest mansions in
the "South End," in its day&mdash;stood near the road over
which the gardeners, in times past, used to go to market,
with their loads of vegetables, two days of each week. Old
Gripes would be up before day, and on the lookout for
these wagons.</p>

<p>"Halloo! what have you got there?" says the miser to
the countryman.</p>

<p>"Well, daddy, a little of all sorts; potatoes, cabbages,
turnips, parsnips, and so on. Won't you look at 'em?"</p>

<p>At this, the old miser would begin to fumble over the
vegetables, pocket a <ins title="potatoe">potato</ins>, an onion, turnip, or&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, they are good enough, but we poor creatures
can't afford to pay such prices as you ask; no, no&mdash;we
must wait until they come down." The old miser would
sneak into the house with his stolen vegetables, and the
farmer would drive on. Then back would come the miser,
and lay in ambush for another load, and thus, in course of
a few hours, he would raise enough vegetables to give his
household a dinner. Another "dodge" of this artful old
dodger, was to take all the coppers he got (and, of course,
a poor creature like him handled a great many), and then
go abroad among the stores and trade off six for a fourpence,
and when he had four fourpences, get a quarter of a
dollar for them, and thus in getting a dollar, he made four
per cent., by several hours' disgusting meanness and labor.</p>

<p>But one day the old miser ran foul of a snag. A market-man
had watched him for some time purloining his vegetables,
and on the first of the year, sent in a bill of several
dollars, for turnips, potatoes, parsnips, &amp;c. The old miser,
of course, refused to pay the bill, denying ever having had
"the goods." But the countryman called, in <i>propria persona</i>,
refreshed his memory, and added, that, if the bill
was not footed on sight, he should prosecute him for
<i>stealing!</i> This made the old miser shake in his boots. He
blustered for awhile; then reasoned the case; then plead
poverty. But the purveyor in vegetables was not the man
to be cabbaged in that way, and the old miser called him
into his sitting-room, and ordered his son, a wild young
scamp, to go up stairs and see if he could find five dollars
in any of the drawers or boxes up there. The young man
finally called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dad, which bag shall I take it out of, <i>the gold or silver</i>?"</p>

<p>"Odd zounds!" bawled the old man&mdash;"the boy wants to
let on I've got bags of gold and silver!"</p>

<p>And so he had, many thousands of dollars in good gold
and silver; he hobbled up stairs, got nine half dollars, and
tried to get off fifty cents less than the countryman's bill;
but the countryman was stubborn as a mule, and would not
abate a farthing&mdash;so the old miser had to hobble up stairs
and fetch down his fifty cents more, and the whole operation
was like squeezing bear's grease from a pig's tail, or jerking
out eye-teeth.</p>

<p>The miser never waylaid the market-men again; and not
long after this, he got a spurious dollar put upon him in
one of his "exchanging" operations, and that wound up his
penny shaving.</p>

<p>Time passed&mdash;Death called upon the wretched man of
ingots and money bags,&mdash;but while power remained to
forbid it, the old miser refused to have a physician. When,
to all appearance, his senses were gone, his friends drew
the miser's pantaloons from under his pillow, where he had
always insisted on their remaining during his sleeping hours,
and his last illness&mdash;but as one of the attendants slowly removed
the garment, the poor old man, with a convulsive
effort&mdash;a galvanic-like grab&mdash;threw out his bony, cold hand,
and seized his old pantaloons!</p>

<p>The miser clutched them with a dying grasp; words
struggled in his throat; he could not utter them; his jaw
fell&mdash;he was dead!</p>

<p>Much curiosity was manifested by the friends and relatives
to know what could have caused the poor old man to
cling to his time-worn pantaloons; but the mystery was
soon revealed&mdash;for upon examination of the linings of the
waistbands and watch-fob, over $30,000 in bank notes were
there concealed!</p>

<p>The Lord's pardon and human sympathy be with all such
misguided and wretched slaves of&mdash;money, say we.</p>

<h2><a name="Dog_Day" id="Dog_Day"></a>Dog Day.</h2>


<p>I used to like dogs&mdash;a puppy love that I got bravely
over, since once upon a time, when a Dutch <i>bottier</i>, in
the city of Charleston, S. C., put an end to my poor <i>Sue</i>,&mdash;the
prettiest and most devoted female bull terrier specimen
of the canine race you ever did see, I guess. My <i>Sue</i>
got into the wrong pew, one morning; the crout-eating
cordwainer and she had a dispute&mdash;he, the bullet-headed
ball of wax, ups with his revolver, and&mdash;I was dogless!
I don't think dogs a very profitable investment, and every
man weak enough to keep a dog in a city, ought to pay
for the luxury handsomely&mdash;to the city authorities. Some
people have a great weakness for dogs. Some fancy gentlemen
seem to think it the very apex of highcockalorumdom
to have the skeleton of a greyhound and highly polished
collar&mdash;following them through crowded thorough-fares.
Some young ladies, especially those of doubtful
ages, delight in caressing lumps of white, cotton-looking
dumpy dogs and toting them around, to the disgust of
the lookers-on&mdash;with all the fondness and blind infatuation
of a mamma with her first born, bran new baby. Wherever
you see any quantity of white and black <i>loafers</i>&mdash;Philadelphia,
for instance, you'll see rafts of ugly and wretched
looking curs. Boz says poverty and oysters have a great
affinity; in this country, for oysters read <i>dogs</i>. Who has
not, that ever travelled over this remarkable country, had
occasion to be down on dogs? Who that has ever lain
awake, for hours at a stretch, listening to a blasted cur, not
worth to any body the powder that would blow him up&mdash;but
has felt a desire to advocate the dog-law, so judiciously
practised in all well-regulated cities? Who that ever had
a sneaking villanous cur slip up behind and <i>nip</i> out a patch of
your trowsers, boot top and calf&mdash;the size of an oyster,
but has felt for the pistol, knife or club, and sworn eternal
enmity to the whole canine race? Who that ever had a
big dog jump upon your Russia-ducks and patent leathers&mdash;just
as he had come out of a mud-puddle, but has nearly
forfeited his title to Christianity, by cursing aloud in his
grief&mdash;like a trooper? Well, I have, for one of a thousand.</p>

<p>The fact of the business is, with precious few exceptions,
dogs are a nuisance, whatever Col. Bill Porter of the
"Spirit," and his thousand and one dog-fancying and inquiring
friends, may think to the contrary; and the man
that will invest fifty real dollars in a dog-skin, has got a
tender place in his head, not healed up as it ought to be.</p>

<p>While "putting up," t'other day, at the Irving House,
New York, I heard a good dog story that will bear repeating,
I think. A sporting gent from the country, stopping at
the Irving, wanted a dog, a good dog, not particular
whether it was a spaniel, hound, pointer, English terrier
or Butcher's bull. So a friend advised him to put an advertisement
in the Sun and Spirit of the Times, which he
did, requesting the "fancy" to bring along the right sort
of dog to the Irving House, room number &mdash;.</p>

<p>The advertisement appeared simultaneously in the two
papers on Saturday. There were but few calls that day;
but on Monday, the "Spirit" having been freely imbibed
by its numerous readers over Sunday, the dog men were
awake, and then began the scene. The occupant of room
number &mdash;had scarcely got up, before a servant appeared
with a man and a dog.</p>

<p>"Believe, sir, you advertised for a dog?" quoth he with the animal.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the response of the country fancy man, who,
by the way, it must be premised, was rather green as to
the quality and prices of fancy dogs.</p>

<p>"What kind of a dog do you call that?" he added.</p>

<p>"A greyhound, full blooded, sir."</p>

<p>"Full blooded?" says the country sportsman. "Well,
he don't look as though he had much blood in him. He'd
look better, wouldn't he, mister, if he was full bellied&mdash;looks
as hollow as a flute!"</p>

<p>This remark, for a moment, rather staggered the dog
man, who first looked at his dog and then at the critic.
Choking down his dander, or disgust, says he:</p>

<p>"That's the best greyhound you ever saw, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you ask for him?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-five dollars."</p>

<p>"What? Seventy-five dollars for that dog frame?"</p>

<p>"I guess you're a fool any way," says the dog man:
"you don't know a hound from a tan yard cur, you jackass!
Phe-e-wt! come along, Jerry!" and the man and dog disappeared.</p>

<p>The man with the hollow dog had not stepped out two
minutes, before the servant appeared with two more dog
merchants; both had their specimens along, and were invited
to "step in."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's a dog!" ejaculated the country sportsman,
the moment his eyes lit upon the massive proportions of a
thundering edition of Mt. St. Bernard.</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> a dog, sir," was the emphatic response of the
dog merchant.</p>

<p>"How much do you ask for that dog?" quoth the sportsman.</p>

<p>"Well," says the trader, patting his dog, "I thought
of getting about fifty-five dollars for him, but I&mdash;"</p>

<p><a id="Pg_136" name="Pg_136"></a>"Stop," interrupted the country sportsman, "that's
enough&mdash;he won't suit, no how; I can't go them figures
on dogs." The man and dog left growling, and the next
man and dog were brought up.</p>

<p>"Why, that's a queer dog, mister, ain't it? 'Tain't got
no hair on it; why, where in blazes did you raise such a
dog as that; been scalded, hain't it?" says the rural sportsman,
examining the critter.</p>

<p>"Scalded?" echoed the dog man, looking no ways amiable
at the speaker, "why didn't you never see a Chinese
terrier, afore?"</p>

<p>"No, and if that's one, I don't care about seeing another.
Why, he looks like a singed possum?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're a pooty looking country jake, you are, to
advertise for a <i>dog</i>, and don't know Chiney terrier from a
singed possum?"</p>

<p>Another rap at the door announced more dogs, and as
the man opened it to get out with his singed possum, a
genus who evidently "killed for Keyser," rushed in with a
pair of the ugliest-looking&mdash;savage&mdash;snub-nosed, slaughter-house
pups, "the fancy" might ever hope to look upon!
As these meat-axish canines made a rush at the very boot
tops of the country sportsman, he "shied off," pretty perceptibly.</p>

<p><a id='illo1ref' name='illo1ref'></a>"Are you de man advertised for de dogs, sa-a-ay? You
needn't be afraid o' dem; come a'here, lay da-own, Balty&mdash;day's
de dogs, mister, vot you read of!"</p>

<p>"Ain't they rather fierce?" asked the rural sportsman,
eyeing the ugly brutes.</p>

<p>"Fierce? Better believe dey are&mdash;show 'em a f-f-ight,
if you want to see 'em go in for de chances! You want
to see der teeth?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," timidly responded the sportsman;
"they are not exactly what I want," he continued.</p>

<p>"What," says Jakey, "don't want 'em? Why, look
a'here, you don't go for to say dat you 'spect I'm agoin'
for to fetch d-dogs clean down here, for nuthin', do you,
sa-a-ay? Cos if you do, I'll jis drop off my duds and lam
ye out o' yer boots!"</p>

<p>Jakey was just beginning to square, when his belligerent
propositions were suddenly nipped in the bud, by the servant
opening the door and ushering in more dogs; and no
sooner did Jakey's pups see the new-comers, than they
went in; a fight ensued&mdash;both of Jakey's pups lighting
down on an able-bodied, big-bone sorrel dog, who appeared
perfectly happy in the transaction, and having a tremendous
jaw of his own, made the bones of the pups crack
with the high pressure he gave them. Of course a dog
fight is the <i>cue</i> for a man fight, and in the wag of a dead
lamb's tail, Jakey and the proprietor of the sorrel dog had
a dispute. Jakey was attitudinizing <i>a la</i> "the fancy," when
the sorrel dog man&mdash;who, like his dog, was got up on a
liberal scale of strength and proportions&mdash;walked right
into Jakey's calculations, and whirled him in double flip-flaps
on to the wash-stand of the rural sportsman's room!
Our sporting friend viewed the various combatants more in
bodily fear than otherwise, and was making a break for the
door, to clear himself, when, to his horror and amazement,
he found the entry beset by sundry men and boys, and any
quantity of dogs&mdash;dogs of every hue, size, and description.
At that moment the chawed-up pups of Jakey, and their
equally used-up master, came a rushing down stairs&mdash;another
fight ensued on the stairs between Jakey's dogs and
some others, and then a stampede of dogs&mdash;mixing up of
dogs&mdash;tangling of ropes and straps&mdash;cursing and hurraing,
and such a time generally, as is far better imagined than
described. The boarders hearing such a wild outcry&mdash;to
say nothing of the yelps of dogs, came out of their various
rooms, and retired as quickly, to escape the stray and confused
dogs, that now were ki-yi-ing, yelping, and pitching
all over the house! By judicious marshalling of the servants&mdash;broom-sticks,
rolling-pins and canes, the dogs and
their various proprietors were ejected, and order once
more restored; the country sportsman seized his valise,
paid his bills and "vamosed the ranche," and ever after it
was incorporated in the rules of the Irving, that gentlemen
are strictly prohibited from dealing in dogs while "putting
up" in that house.</p>

<p>"I don't see what in sin's become of them dahlias I set
out this Spring," said Tapehorn, a retired slop-shop merchant,
to his wife, one morning a month ago, as he hunted
in vain among the weeds and grass of his garden, to see
where or when his two-dollars-a-piece dahlia roots were
going to appear.</p>

<p>"Can't think what's the matter with 'em," he continued.
"Goldblossom said they were the finest roots he ever sold&mdash;ought
to be up and in bloom&mdash;two months ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, pa, I forgot to tell you," said Miss Tapehorn,
"that our Patrick, one morning last Spring, was digging in

<h2><a name="at_the_Tremont" id="at_the_Tremont"></a>The Two Johns at the Tremont.</h2>


<p>It is somewhat curious that more embarrassments, and
queer <i>contre temps</i> do not take place in the routine of
human affairs, when we find so <i>many</i> persons floating about
of one and the same name. It must be shocking to be
named John Brown, troublesome to be called John Thompson,
but who can begin to conceive the horrors of that
man's situation, who has at the baptismal font received the
title of <i>John Smith</i>?</p>

<p>Now it only wants a slight accident, the most trivial occurrence
of fate&mdash;the meeting of two or three persons of
the same name, or of great similarity of name, to create the
most singular and even ludicrous circumstances and tableaux.
One of these affairs came off at the Tremont
House, some time since. One Thomas Johns, a blue-nose
Nova-Scotian&mdash;a man of "some pumpkins" and "persimmons"
at home, doubtless, put up for a few days at the
Tremont, and about the same time one John Thomas, a
genuine son of John Bull, just over in one of the steamers,
took up his quarters at the same respectable and worthy establishment.</p>

<p>Thomas Johns was a linen draper, sold silks, satinets,
linen, and dimities, at his establishment in the Provinces,
and was also a politician, and "went on" for the part of
magistrate, occasionally. John Thomas was a retired wine-merchant,
and, having netted a bulky fortune, he took it
into his head to <i>travel</i>, and as naturally as he despised, and
as contemptuously as he looked upon this poor, wild, unsophisticated
country of ours, he nevertheless condescended
to come and look at us.</p>

<p>Well, there they were, Thomas Johns, and John Thomas;
one was "roomed" in the north wing, the other in the
south wing. Thomas Johns went out and began reconnoitering
among the Yankee shop-keepers. John Thomas,
having a fortnight's pair of sea legs on, and full of bile and
beer, laid up at his lodgings, and passed the first three
days in "hazing around" the servants, and blaspheming
American manners and customs.</p>

<p>Old John was quietly snoring off his bottle after a sumptuous
Tremont dinner, when a repeated rap, rap, rap at his
door aroused him.</p>

<p>"What are you&mdash;at?" growls John.</p>

<p>"It's ma, zur?" says one of the Milesian servants.</p>

<p>"Blast yer hies, what want yer?" again growls John.</p>

<p>"If ye plaze, zur, there's a young man below wishes to
see you," says the servant.</p>

<p>"Ha, tell 'im to clear out!" John having predestinated
the "young man," he gave an apoplectic snort, relapsed
into his lethargy, and the servant whirled down into the
rotunda, and informed the "young man" what the gentleman desired.</p>

<p>"He did, eh?" says the young man, who looked as if he
might be a clerk in an importing house. The young man
left, in something of a high dudgeon.</p>

<p>"What'r yer at now?" roared John Thomas, a second
time, roused by the servant's rat-tat-too.</p>

<p>"It's a gentleman wants to see yez's, zur."</p>

<p>"Tell him to go to the d&mdash;!" and John snored again.</p>

<p>"Is John in?" asks the gentleman, as the servant returns.</p>

<p>"Mister <i>Thomas</i> did yez mane, zur?"</p>

<p>"No, yes, it is (looking at his tablets) same thing, I suppose;
Thomas Johns," says the gentleman.</p>

<p>"I belave it's right, zur," says the servant.</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I think he's not in a good humor, betwane us,
zur; he says yez may go to the divil!"</p>

<p>"Did he? Well, that's polite, any how&mdash;invite a gentleman
to dine with him, and then meet him with such language
as that. The infernal 'blue nose,' I'll pull it, I'll
tweak it until he'll roar like a calf!" and off went "the
gentleman," hot as No. 6.</p>

<p>"I belave he's not in, zur," says the same servant, answering
another inquiry for John Thomas, or Thomas
Johns, the carriage driver was not certain which.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" says the servant, "it's a ride ould John's going
fur to take till himself, and didn't want any callers."
Reaching John's door, he began his tattoo.</p>

<p>"Be hang'd to ye, what'r ye at now?" growls John,
partly up and dressed.</p>

<p>"The carriage is here, zur."</p>

<p>"What carriage is that?" growls John, continuing his toilet.</p>

<p>"I don't know, zur; I'll go down and sae the <i>number</i>, if
ye plaze."</p>

<p>"Thunder and tommy! What do I care for the number?
Go tell the carriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To go to the divil, zur?" says the servant, in anticipation
of the command.</p>

<p>"No, you bog-trotter, go tell the carriage to wait."</p>

<p>The servant went down, and John continued his toilet, muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, some of their <i>haccommodations</i>, I expect; these
American landlords, as they style 'em in these infernal wild
woods 'ere, do manage to give a body tolerable sort of haccommodations;
ha, but they'll take care to look hout for
the dollars. I don't know, tho', these fellers 'ere appear tolerably
clever; want me to ride hout, I suppose, and see some
of their Yankee lions. Haw! haw! <i>Lions!</i> I wonder what
they'd say hif they saw Lun'un, and looked at St. Paul's once!"</p>

<p>Getting through his toilet&mdash;and it takes an Englishman
as long to fix his stiff cravat and that <i>stiffer</i> and stauncher
shirt-collar, and rub his hat, than a Frenchman to rig out
<i>tout ensemble</i>, to say nothing of the gallons of water and
dozens of towels he uses up in the operation&mdash;John found
the carriage waiting; he asked no questions, but jumped in.</p>

<p>"Isn't there some others beside yourself going out, sir?"
says the driver, supposing he had the right man, or one of them.</p>

<p>"No; drive off&mdash;where are you going to drive me?"</p>

<p>"Mount Auburn, sir, the carriage was ordered for."</p>

<p>"Humph! Some of the <i>battle-grounds</i>, I suppose," John
grunts to himself, falls into a fit of English doggedness, and
the coach drives off.</p>

<p>Thomas Johns made little or no noise or confusion in the
house, consequently he was not known to the servants, and
very little known to the clerks. John Thomas was another
person&mdash;he was all fuss and feathers. He kept his bell
ringing, and the servants rushing for towels and water,
water and towels, boots and beer, beer and boots, the English
papers, maps of America, &amp;c., without cessation. He
was John Thomas and Thomas Johns, one and indivisible.</p>

<p>John got his ride, and returned to the hotel sulkier than
ever; and by the time he got unrobed of his pea-jackets
and huge shawls about his burly neck, he was telegraphed
by a servant to come down; there was a gentleman below
on business with him. John foreswore business, but the
gentleman must see him, and up he came for that purpose.
His unmistakable <i>mug</i> told he was "an officer."</p>

<p>"I've a bill against you, sir, $368,20. Must be paid immediately!"
said the presenter, peremptorily.</p>

<p>John was thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"Me, and be hanged to ye!" says John, getting his breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, for goods packed at Smith &amp; Brown's, for
Nova Scotia. The bill was to be paid this morning, as
you agreed, but you told the clerk to go to the d&mdash;l! Won't
do, that sort of work, here. Pay the bill, or you must go with me!"</p>

<p>John, when he found himself in custody, swore it was
some infernal Yankee scheme to gouge him, and he started
for the clerk's office, below, to have some explanation. As
John and the officer reached the rotunda, a gentleman steps
up behind John, and gives his nose a first-rate <i>lug</i>. They
clinched, the bystanders and servants interposed, and John
and his assailant were parted, and by this time the nose
puller discovered he had the wrong man by the nose!</p>

<p>"Is your name Thomas Johns?" says the nose puller.</p>

<p>"Blast you, no!"</p>

<p>"Who pays this bill for the carriage, if your name ain't
Johns?" says a man with a bill for the carriage hire.</p>

<p>"I allers heard as ow you Yan-gees were inquisitive,
and sharp after the dollars, and I'm 'anged if you ain't awful.
My name's John Thomas, from Lun'un, bound back again
in the next steamer. Now who's got any thing against <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>Thomas Johns came in at this climax, an explanation
ensued, John was relieved of his embarrassment, and all
were finally satisfied, except John Thomas, who, venting a
few bottles of his spleen on every body and all things&mdash;Americans
especially&mdash;took to his bed and beer, and snorted for a week.</p>

<h2><a name="a_Boarding_School" id="a_Boarding_School"></a>The Yankee in a Boarding School.</h2>


<p>"Well, squire, as I wer' tellin' on ye, when I went
around pedlin' notions, I met many queer folks;
some on 'em so darn'd preoud and sassy, they wouldn't let
a feller look at 'em; a-n-d 'd shut their doors and gates,
<i>bang</i> into a feller's face, jest as ef a Yankee pedler was a
pizen sarpint! Then there waa-s t'other kind o' human
critters, so pesky poor, or 'nation stingy, they'd pinch a
fourpence till it'd squeal like a stuck pig. Ye-e-s, I do
<i>swow</i>, I've met some critters so dog-ratted mean, that ef
you had sot a steel trap onder their beds, a-n-d baited it
with three cents, yeou'd a cotch ther con-feoun-ded souls
afore mornin'!"</p>

<p>"Massy sakes!" responded the squire.</p>

<p>"Fact! by ginger!" echoed the ex-pedler.</p>

<p>"Well, go on, Ab," said the squire, giving his pipe
another 'charge,' and lighting up for the yarn Absalom
Slamm had promised the gals, soon as the quilt was out
and refreshments were handed around.</p>

<p>"Go on, Ab&mdash;let's hear abeout that scrape yeou had with
the school marm and her gals."</p>

<p>"Wall, I <i>will</i>, squire; gals, spread yeourselves areound
and squat; take care o' yeour corset strings, and keep
deth-ly still. Wall; neow, yeou all sot? Hain't none o'
ye been in the pedlin' business, I guess; wall, no matter,
tho' it's dread-ful pleasant sometimes: then again at
others, 'taint."</p>

<p>"Go on, Ab, go on," said the squire.</p>

<p>"Ye-e-s; wall, as I was saying, 'beout tradin', none o'
yeou ever been in the tradin' way? Wall, it deon't matter
a cent; as I was agoin' to say, I had hard, hard luck one
season&mdash;got clean busted all tew smash! O-o-o! it was
<i>dre-a-a-dful times</i>; jest abeout the time Gineral Jackson
clapped his <i>we-toe</i> on the hull o' the banks, kersock. Wall,
yeou see, I got broke all tew flinders. My ole hoss died,
the sun and rain beat up my wagon, I sold eout my
notions tew a feller that paid me all in ceounter-fit money,
and then he dug eout, as Parson Dodge says, to undiskivered kedn'try.</p>

<p>"There was only one way abeout it; I was beound to
dew somethin', instead o' goin' to set deown and blubber;
and as I layed stretched eout in bed one Sunday morning,
in Marm Smith's tavern, in the cockloft among the old
stuff, I spies a darn'd ole consarn that took my fancy immazin'!
As Deb Brown said, when she 'sperienced rele-gen,
I felt my sperrets raisin' me clean eout o' bed, and eout I
beounced, like a pea in a hot skillet. Deown I goes to
Marm Smith; the ole lady was dressed up to death in her
Sunday-go-to-meetin's, and jest as preoud and sassy as her
darn'd ole skin ceould heould in.</p>

<p>"'Marm Smith,' sez I, 'yeou hain't got no ole stuff yeou
deon't want tew sell nor nuthin', dew ye?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Ab Slamm</i>,' sez she, plantin' her thumbs on her hip
joints, and as the milishey officer ses on trainin' day, comin'
at me, 'right face,' she spread herself like a clapboard.
'Ab Slamm,' sez she, 'what on airth possesses yeou to talk
o' tradin' on the Sabbath?'</p>

<p>"'Wall,' sez I, 'Marm Smith, yeou needn't take on so
'beout it; I guess a feller kin ax a question witheout tradin'
or breakin' the Sabbath all tew smash, either! Neow,'
says I, 'yeou got some ole plunder up ther in the cockloft,
where yeou stuck me to sleep; 'tain't much use to yeou, and
one article I see I want to trade fur.'</p>

<p>"Wall, we didn't trade <i>'zactly</i>. Marm Smith, yeou see,
got dre-e-e-adful relejus 'beout that time&mdash;wouldn't let her
gals draw ther breth scacely, and shot her roosters all up
in the cellar every Sunday. Fact, by ginger! Wall, yeou
see, Marm Smith were agin tradin' on Sunday, but she sed
I might arrange it with Ben, her barkeeper, and so I got
the instrument, <i>any heow</i>."</p>

<p>"What was it, Ab?" inquired the squire.</p>

<p>"Massy sakes, tell us!" says the gals.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't dew it, till I tell the hull abeout it," Ab replied,
rather choosing, like Captain Cuttle, to break the
gist of his information into small chunks, and so make it
the more <i>telling</i> and comparatively interesting.</p>

<p>"When I got the <i>instrument</i>, and paid Marm Smith my
board bill, I wer in possession of a cash capital of jest three
fo'pences. I took my jack-knife, and unjinted the instrument,
cleaned it off, then wrapped the different sections up
in a paper, put the hull in my little yaller trunk, and dug
eout. When I got clean eout o' sight and hearin' of everybody
I'd ever hear'n tell on, I stopped r-i-g-h-t in my track.
My cash capital wer gone, my mortal remains were holler as
a flute, and my old trunk had worn a hole clean through
the shoulder o' my best Sunday coat. I put up, and sez I
tew the landlord:</p>

<p>"'Squire, what sort o' place is this for a sheow?'</p>

<p>"'For a sh-e-ow?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Ye-e-e-s,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'What a' yeou got to sh-e-o-w?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'The most wonderful instrument ever inwent-'d,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'What's 't fur?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'For the wimen,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'O! sez he, lookin' alfired peart and smeart, as tho'
he'd seen a flock o' l'fants; 'quack doctor, I s'pose, eh?'</p>

<p>"'No, I ben't a quack doctor, nuther,' sez I, priming
up at the insin-i-wa-tion.</p>

<p>"'Wall, what on airth hev yeou got, <i>any heow</i>?' sez he.</p>

<p>"When he 'poligized in that sort o' way, in course I up
and told him the full perticklers 'beout a wonderful <i>instrument</i>
I had for the ladies and wimen folks. A-n-d heow I
wanted to sheow it before some o' the female sim-i-nar-ries,
and give a lectoor on't.</p>

<p>"'By bunker!' sez he, 'then yeou've cum jest teou the
spot; three miles up the road is the great <i>Jargon Institoot</i>,
'spressly for young ladies, wher they teach 'em the 'rethmetic,
French scollopin', and High-tall-ion curlycues;
dancin', tight-lacin', hair-dressin', and so forth, with the
use of curlin' irons, forty pinanners, and parfumeries
chuck'd in.'</p>

<p>"'Yeou deon't <i>say</i> so?' sez I.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I doos,' sez he; and then yeou had orter seen
me make streaks fur the Jargon Institoot.</p>

<p>"I feound the place, knocked on the door, and a feller
all starch'd up, lookin' cruel nice, kem and opened the
door. I axed if the marm were in. Then he wanted tew
kneow which of 'em I wanted tew see. 'The head marm
of the Institoot,' sez I. 'Please to give me yeour keard,'
sez he. 'You be darn'd,' sez I; 'I'd have yeou know,
mister,' sez I, 'I don't deal in <i>keards</i>&mdash;never did, nuther!'</p>

<p>"The feller show'd a heap o' ivory, and brought deown
the head marm. It weould a' dun Marm Smith's ole
heart good to seen this dre-e-a-d-ful pius critter. She looked
mighty nice, a-n-d she scolloped reound, and beow'd and
cut an orful quantity o' capers, when I ondid my business
to her. I went on and told her heow in course o' travel&mdash;</p>

<p>"'In furrin pearts?' sez she.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' sez I&mdash;'I kim across a great instrument,' sez I.
'It was well known to the wimen and ladies o' the past
gin-i-rations,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'The an-shants?' sez she.</p>

<p>"'Yes, marm,' sez I. Then she axed me wether it wer
a wind instrer-ment or a stringed instrer-ment. A-n-d I
told her it wer a stringed instrer-ment, but went on the
hurdy-gurdy pren-cipl', with a crank or treddle. But what
I moost dwelt on, as the ox-ion-eer sez, were the great
combinations of the instrer-ment, a-n-d I piled it up dre-e-e-adful!
I told the marm I wanted to git the thing patented,
and put before the people&mdash;the wimen and ladies in per-tick'ler&mdash;so
that every gal in the univarsal world could
play upon it&mdash;exercise her hands, strengthen her arms
and chist, give her form a nater-al de-welop-ment, and
so make the hull grist o' wimen critters useful, as
well as or-namental, as my instrer-ment was a useful
necessity; for while it lent grace and beauty to the
female form, and gin forth fust rate music, it was par-fect-ly
scriptooral; it ceould be made to clothe the naked and feed
the hon-gry. My il-o-quince had the marm. She 'greed
to buy one of my machines <i>straight</i> fur use of her <i>Institoot</i>&mdash;each
school-gal to 'put in' by next day, when I wer to
bring the instrer-ment, get my $40, and deliver a lectoor on
it. Next mornin', bright and early, I wer there; the <i>puss</i>
wer made up, and the gals nigh abeout bilin' over with
curiosity to see my wonderful <i>hand-limberer, arm-strengthener,
chist-expander, female-beautifier, and univarsal
musical machine!</i> When they all got assembled, I ondid
the machine; they wer still as death! When I sot it up,
they wer breathless with wonderment; when I started it,
they gin a gineral screech of delight. Then I sot deown
and played 'em <i>old hund'erd</i>, and every gal in the room
vowed right eout she'd have one made <i>straight!</i> O-o-o!
yeou'd a died to seen the excitement that instrer-ment made
in Jargon Institoot. The head marm wanted my ortergraff,
and each o' the gals a lock o' my hair. But just then,
a confeounded ole woolly-headed Virginny nigger wench,
cook o' the Jargon Institoot, kem in, and the moment she
clapped her ole eyes on my inwention, she roared reight
eout, 'O! de <i>Lud</i>, ef dar ain't one de ole Virginny <i>spinnin'
wheels!</i>' I kinder had bus'ness somewheres else 'beout
that time! I took with a leaving!"</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="State_of_Excitement" id="State_of_Excitement"></a>A Dreadful State of Excitement.</h2>


<p>A retrospective view of some ten or fifteen years,
brings up a wonderful "heap of notions," which at their
birth made quite a different sensation from that which their
"bare remembrance" would seem to sanction now. The statement
made in a "morning paper" before us, of a fine horse
being actually scared stone and instantaneously dead, by a
roaring and hissing locomotive, brings to mind "a circumstance,"
which though it did not exactly <i>do our knitting</i>, it
came precious near the climax!</p>

<p>Some years ago, upon what was then considered the
"frontier" of Missouri, we chanced to be laid up with a
"game leg," in consequence of a performance of a bullet-headed
mule that we were endeavoring to coerce at the end
of a corn stalk, for his "intervention" in a fodder stack to
which he could lay no legitimate claim. About two miles
from our "lodgings" was a store, a "grocery," shotecary
pop, boots, hats, gridirons, whiskey, powder and shot, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., and the post office. About three times a week, we
used to hobble down to this modern ark, to read the news,
see what was going on down in the world, and&mdash;pass a few
hours with the proprietor of the store, who chanced to
be a man with whom we had had a former acquaintance "in
other climes." Well, one day, we dropped down to the
store, and found pretty much all the men folks&mdash;and they
were not numerous around there, the houses or cabins being
rather scattering&mdash;getting ready to go down the river
(Missouri) some ten miles, to see a notorious desperado
"stretch hemp." My friend Captain V&mdash;&mdash;, the storekeeper,
was about to go along too, and proposed that we
should mount and accompany him, or&mdash;stay and tend store.
We accepted the latter proposition, as we were in no travelling
kelter, and had no taste for performances on the
tight rope. Having officiated for Captain V&mdash;&mdash; on several
former occasions, we had the run of his "grocery" and
<i>postal</i> arrangements quite fluent enough to take charge of
all the trade likely to turn up that day; so the captain and
his friends started, promising a return before sunset.</p>

<p>One individual, living some seven miles up the road, called
for his newspaper, and got his jug filled, spent a couple of
hours with us&mdash;put out, and was succeeded by two squalid
Indians, with some skins to trade for corn juice and tobacco;
they cleared out, and about two or three P. M., some
<i>movers</i> came along; we had a little dicker with them, and
that closed up the business accounts of the day.</p>

<p>Having discussed all the availables, from the contents of
the post office&mdash;seven newspapers and four letters per quarter!&mdash;to
the crackers and cheese, and business being essentially
stagnated, we ups and lies down upon the top of the
counter, to take a nap. Captain V&mdash;&mdash;'s store was a log
building, about 15 by 30, and stood near the edge of the
woods, and at least half a mile from any habitation, except
the schoolhouse and blacksmith's shop, two small huts, and
at that time&mdash;"in coventry." Captain V&mdash;&mdash; was a bachelor;
he boarded&mdash;that is, he took his meals at the nearest
house&mdash;half a mile back from the wood, and slept in his
store. We soon fell into the soft soothing arms of Morpheus,
and&mdash;slept. It was fine mild weather&mdash;September,
and, of course, the door was wide open. How long we
slept we were not at all conscious, but were aroused by a
heavy hand that gave us a hearty shake by the shoulder,
and in a rather sepulchral voice says&mdash;</p>

<p>"How are you?"</p>

<p>Gods! we were up quick, for our sleep had been visited
by dreams of southwest tragedies, hanging scrapes, and
other nightmare affairs, and as we opened our eyes and
caught a glimpse of the double-fisted, cadaverous fellow
standing over us, a strong inclination to go off into a cold
sweat seized us! Lo! it was after sunset! Almost dark
in the store, the stars had already began to twinkle in the sky.</p>

<p>Captain V&mdash;&mdash; did a considerable trade at his store, and
at times had considerable sums of money laying around.
Upon leaving in the morning, he notified us, in case we
should require <i>change</i>, to look into the desk, where he kept
a shot bag of silver coin, and&mdash;his pistols.</p>

<p>"<ins title="Ho">How</ins> are you?" the words and manner and looks of the
man gave us a cold chill.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" we managed to respond, at the same
time sliding down behind the counter. The stranger had
a heavy walking stick in his hand, and a knapsack looking
bundle swung to his shoulder. He looked like the rough
remnants of an ill-spent life; had evidently travelled
somewhere where barbers, washer-women and such like
civilian delicacies, were more matters of tradition than fact.</p>

<p>"Been asleep, eh?" he carelessly continued.</p>

<p>"It appears so," said we, feeling no better or more satisfactory
in our mind, and no reason to, for night was
now closing in, and we were going through our performances
by the slight illumination of the stars, without any
positive certainty as to where the Captain kept his tinder
box and candle, that we might furnish some sort of light
upon the lugubrious state of affairs.</p>

<p>"Do you keep this store?"</p>

<p>"No, we do not," we answered, watching the man as he
put his bundle down upon the counter.</p>

<p>"Who does?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"The gentleman who keeps it," we replied, "is away to-day."</p>

<p>"Ah, gone to see a poor human being put out of the world, eh?"</p>

<p>We said "yes," or something of the kind, and thought
to ourself, no doubt you know all that's going on of that
sort of business like a book, and a host of other ideas
flashed across our mind, while all the evil deeds of note
transacted in that region for the past ten years, seemed
awakened in our mind's eye, working up our nervous system,
until the coon skin cap upon our excited head stood
upon about fifteen hairs, with the strange and overwhelming
impression that our time had come! We would have
given the State of Missouri&mdash;if it were in our possession,
to have heard Captain V&mdash;&mdash;'s voice, or even have had a fair
chance to dash out at the door, and give the fellow before
us a specimen of tall walking&mdash;lame as we were!</p>

<p>"Ain't you got a <i>light</i>? I'd think you'd be a little timid
(a <i>little</i> timid!) about laying around here, alone, in the dark,
too?" said the fellow, sticking one hand into his coat
pocket, and gazing sharply around the store. Mock heroically
says we&mdash;</p>

<p>"Afraid? Afraid of what?" our valor, like Bob Acres',
oozing out at our fingers.</p>

<p>"These outlaws you've got around here," said he.
"They say the man they hanged to-day was a decent fellow
to what some are, who prowl around in this country!"</p>

<p>We very modestly said, "that such fellows never bothered us."</p>

<p>"Do you sleep in this store&mdash;live here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, we don't," was our answer.</p>

<p>"Where do you lodge and get your eating?"</p>

<p>"First house up the road."</p>

<p>"How far is it?" says he.</p>

<p>"Half a mile or less."</p>

<p>"Well, close up your shop, and come along with me!"
says the fellow.</p>

<p>Now we were coming to the <i>tableaux!</i> He wanted us
to step outside in order that the business could be done for
us, with more haste and certainty, and we really felt as good
as assassinated and hid in the bushes! It was quite astonishing
how our visual organs intensified! We could see
every wrinkle and line in the fellow's face, could almost
count the stitches in his coat, and the more we looked, and
the keener and more searching became our observation, the
more atrocious and subtle became the fellow and his purpose.
With a firmness that astonished ourself, we said&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>No, Sir</i>; if <i>you</i> have business there or elsewhere, you
had better <i>go!</i>" and with this determined speech, we walked
up to the desk, and with the air of a "man of business" or
the nonchalance of a hero, says we&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you after&mdash;have you any business with <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"You're kind of crusty, Mister," says he. "I'm canvassing
this State,&mdash;<i>wouldn't you like to subscribe for a
first-rate map of Missouri</i>, <span class="smcap">or a new Edition of Josephus</span>?"</p>

<p>We felt too mean all over to "subscribe," but we found
a light, and soon found in the stranger one of the best sort
of fellows, a man of information and morality, and, though
he had <i>looked</i> dangerous, he turned out harmless as a lamb,
and we got intimate as brothers before Captain V&mdash;&mdash;
returned that night.</p>

<p>Of all the public lecturers of our time and place, none

consequently the people, than <span class="smcap">Ralph Waldo Emerson</span>.</p>

<p>Lecturing has become quite a fashionable science&mdash;and
now, instead of using the old style phrases for illustrating
facts, we call travelling preachers perambulating showmen,

<p>As a lecturer, Ralph Waldo Emerson is extensively
known around these parts; but whether his lectures come
under the head of law, logic, politics, Scripture, or the
show business, is a matter of much speculation; for our
own part, the more we read or hear of Ralph, the more we
don't know what it's all about.</p>

<p>Somebody has said, that to his singularity of style or
expression, Carlyle and his works owe their great notoriety
or fame&mdash;and many compare Ralph Waldo to old Carlyle.
They cannot trace exactly any great affinity between
these two great geniuses of the flash literary school. Carlyle
writes vigorously, quaintly enough, but almost always
speaks when he says something; on the contrary, our
flighty friend Ralph speaks vigorously, yet says nothing!
Of all men that have ever stood and delivered in presence
of "a reporter," none surely ever led these indefatigable
knights of the pen such a wild-goose chase over the verdant
and flowery pastures of King's English, as Ralph
Waldo Emerson. In ordinary cases, a reporter well versed
in his art, catches a sentence of a speaker, and goes on to
fill it out upon the most correct impression of what was
intended, or what is implied. But no such license
follows the outpourings of Mr. Emerson; no thought can
fathom his intentions, and quite as bottomless are even his
finished sentences. We have known "old stagers," in the
newspaporial line, veteran reporters, so dumbfounded and
confounded by the first fire of Ralph, and his grand and
lofty acrobating in elocution, that they up, seized their hat
and paper, and sloped, horrified at the prospect of an attempt
to "take down" Mr. Emerson.</p>

<p>If Roaring Ralph touches a homely mullen weed, on a
donkey heath, straightway he makes it a full-blown rose, in
the land of Ophir, shedding an odor balmy as the gales of
Arabia; while with a facility the wonderful London auctioneer
Robbins might envy, Ralph imparts to a lime-box,
or pig-sty, a negro hovel, or an Irish shanty, all the romance,
artistic elegance and finish of a first-class manor-house,
or Swiss cottage, inlaid with alabaster and fresco,
surrounded by elfin bowers, grand walks, bee hives, and honeysuckles.</p>

<p>Ralph don't group his metaphorical beauties, or dainties
of Webster, Walker, &amp;c., but rushes them out in torrents&mdash;rattles
them down in cataracts and avalanches&mdash;bewildering,
astounding, and incomprehensible. He hits you
upon the left lug of your <ins title="knowlege">knowledge</ins> box with a metaphor so
unwieldy and original, that your breath is soon gone&mdash;and
before it is recovered, he gives you another <i>rhapsody</i> on
t'other side, and as you try to steady yourself, <i>bim</i> comes
another, heavier than the first two, while a fourth batch of
this sort of elocution fetches you a bang over the eyes, giving
you a vertigo in the ribs of your bewildered senses, and
before you can say "God bless us!" down he has you&mdash;<i>cobim!</i>
with a deluge of high-heeled grammar and three-storied
Anglo Saxon, settling your hash, and brings you to
the ground by the run, as though you were struck by lightning,
or in the way of a 36-pounder! Ralph Waldo is
death and an entire <i>stud</i> of pale horses on flowery expressions
and japonica-domish flubdubs. He revels in all those
knock-kneed, antique, or crooked and twisted words we used
all of us to puzzle our brains over in the days of our youth,
and grammar lessons and rhetoric exercises. He has a
penchant as strong as cheap boarding-house butter, for mystification,
and a free delivery of hard words, perfectly and
unequivocally wonderful. We listened one long hour by
the clock of Rumford Hall, one night, to an outpouring of
<i>argumentum ad hominem</i> of Mr. Emerson's&mdash;at what? A
boy under an apple tree! If ten persons out of the five
hundred present were put upon their oaths, they could no
more have deciphered, or translated Mr. Ralph's argumentation,
than they could the hieroglyphics upon the walls of
Thebes, or the sarcophagus of old King Pharaoh! When
Ralph Waldo opens, he may be as calm as a May morn&mdash;he
may talk for five minutes, like a book&mdash;we mean a common-sensed,
understandable book; but all of a sudden the
fluid will strike him&mdash;up he goes&mdash;down he fetches them.
He throws a double somerset backwards over Asia Minor&mdash;flip-flaps
in Greece&mdash;wings Turkey&mdash;and <i>skeets</i> over Iceland;
here he slips up with a flower garden&mdash;a torrent of
gilt-edged metaphors, that would last a country parson's
moderate demand a long lifetime, are whirled with the fury
and fleetness of Jove's thunderbolts. After exhausting his
sweet-scented receiver of this floral elocution, he pauses
four seconds; pointing to vacuum, over the heads of his audience,
he asks, in an anxious tone, "Do you see that?"
Of course the audience are not expected to be so unmannerly
as to ask "What?" If they were, Ralph would not
give them time to "go in," for after asking them if they see
<i>that</i>, he continues&mdash;</p>

<p>"There! Mark! Note! It is a malaria prism! Now,
then; here&mdash;there; see it! Note it! Watch it!"</p>

<p>During this time, half of the audience, especially the old
women and the children, look around, fearful of the ceiling
falling in, or big bugs lighting on them. But the pause is
for a moment, and anxiety ceases when they learn it was
only a false alarm, only&mdash;</p>

<p>"Egotism! The lame, the pestiferous exhalation or concrete
malformation of society!"</p>

<p>You breathe freer, and Ralph goes in, gloves on.</p>

<p>"Egotism! A metaphysical, calcareous, oleraceous
amentum of&mdash;society! The mental varioloid of this sublunary
hemisphere! One of its worst feelings or features
is, the craving of sympathy. It even loves sickness, because
actual pain engenders signs of sympathy. All cultivated
men are infected more or less with this dropsy. But
they are still the leaders. The life of a few men is the life of
every place. In Boston you hear and see a few, so in New
York; then you may as well die. Life is very narrow. Bring
a few men together, and under the spell of one calm genius,
what frank, sad confessions will be made! Culture is the
suggestion from a few best thoughts that a man should not be
a charlatan, but temper and subdue life. Culture redresses
his balance, and puts him among his equals. It is a poor
compliment always to talk with a man upon his <i>specialty</i>,
as if he were a cheese-mite, and was therefore strong on
Cheshire and Stilton. Culture takes the grocer out of his
molasses and makes him genial. We pay a heavy price for
those fancy goods, Fine Arts and Philosophy. No performance
is worth loss of geniality. That unhappy man
called of genius, is an unfortunate man. Nature always
carries her point despite the means!"</p>

<p>If that don't convince you of Ralph's high-heeled,
knock-kneed logic, or <i>au fait</i> dexterity in concocting flap-doodle
mixtures, you're ahead of ordinary intellect as far
as this famed lecturer is in advance of gin and bitters, or
opium discourses on&mdash;delirium tremens!</p>

<p>In short, Ralph Waldo Emerson can wrap up a subject
in more mystery and science of language than ever a
defunct Egyptian received at the hands of the mummy manufacturers!
In person, Mr. Ralph is rather a pleasing sort
of man; in manners frank and agreeable; about forty
years of age, and a native of Massachusetts. As a lawyer,
he would have been the horror of jurors and judges; as a
lecturer, he is, as near as possible, what we have described him.</p>

<h2><a name="Humbug" id="Humbug"></a>Humbug.</h2>


<p>There is no end to the humbug in life. About half we
say, and more than half we do, is tinged with humbug.
"My Dear Sir," we say, when we address a letter to a fellow
we have never seen, and if seen, perhaps don't care a
continental cent for him; <i>dear</i> sir! what a humbug expression!
"Good morning," (what a lie!) says one, as he
meets another <i>one</i>, on a stormy and nasty day, "quite a
disagreeable wet day!" What's the use of such a humbug
expression as that? If it's a disagreeable and stormy day,
every body finds it out, naturally. Full half of the people
who appear solicitous about your <i>health</i>, display a gratuitous
amount of humbug, for your pocket-book is more beloved
than your health; and we have often wondered why
matter-of-fact people don't out with it, when they meet, and
say&mdash;"How's your pocket to-day? Sorry to hear you're
out of <i>money!</i>" Or, instead of soft soap, when they meet,
why not discard humbug, and say, "Sorry to see you&mdash;was
blackguarding you all day!" instead of "Glad to see you&mdash;have
been <i>thinking</i> of you to-day!" or, "I'm glad to see
you've been elected Mayor of the city!" when in fact they
mean, "Curse you, I wish you had been defeated!" Compliments
<i>pass</i>, they say, when <i>gentlemen</i> meet, but, as there
are so many counterfeit gentry around, now-a-days, you may
bet high that half the <i>compliments</i> that <i>pass</i>
are&mdash;<i>mere bogus!</i></p>

<h2><a name="Hotel_Keeping" id="Hotel_Keeping"></a>Hotel Keeping.</h2>


<p>Fortunes are made&mdash;very readily, it is said, in our
large cities, by Hotel keeping. It does look money-making
business to a great many people, who stop in a
large hotel a day or two, and perhaps, after eating about
two meals out of six&mdash;walking in quietly and walking out
quietly&mdash;no fuss, no feathers, find themselves <i>taxed</i> four or
five dollars!</p>

<p>We have had occasion to know something of travel and
travellers, hotels, hotel-keepers and their bills, and it <i>has</i>
now and then entered our head that money was or could
be made&mdash;in the hotel business. We <i>have</i> stopped in
houses where we honestly concluded&mdash;we got our money's
worth, and we have again had reason to believe ourselves
grossly shaved, in a "first-class" hotel, at two dollars a
day&mdash;all hurry-scurry, poked up in the cock-loft, mid bugs,
dirt, heat and effluvia, very little better than a Dutch tavern
in fly time.</p>

<p>We did not fail to observe at the same time, that cool
impudence and clamor had a most mollifying effect upon
landlord and his <i>attaches</i>, the tinsel and mere electrotypes
passing for real bullion, galvanized <i>hums</i> by their noise and
pretensions faring fifty per cent. better for the same <i>price</i>&mdash;than
the more republican, quiet and human wayfarer.</p>

<p>Under such auspices, it is not at all wonderful that ourself
and scores of others, paying two dollars and a half per
diem, got what we could catch, while Kossuth, and a score
of his followers, fared and were favored like princes of a
monarchical realm&mdash;"though all <i>dead heads!</i>"</p>

<p>Hotels now-a-days must be <i>showy</i>, abounding in tin foil,
Dutch metal and gamboge, a thousand of the "modern
improvements"&mdash;mere clap-trap, and as foreign to the solid
comforts of solid people, as icebergs to Norwegians or
"east winds" to the consumptive. Without the show, they
would be quite deserted; men will pay for this <i>show</i>, must
pay for it, and all this show costs money; Turkey carpets,
life-size mirrors, ottomans and marble slabs, from dome to
kitchen, <i>draw well</i>, and those who indulge in the dance,
must pay the piper.</p>

<p>The fact is, most people understand these things about
as well as we do, and it but remains for us to give a daguerreotype
of a <i>few customers</i> which landlords or their
clerks and servants now and then meet. The conductor of
one of our first-class houses, gives us such a truly piquant
and matter-of-fact picture of <i>his</i> experience, that we <i>up</i>
and copy it, believing, as we do, that the reader will see
some information and amusement in the subject.</p>

<p>A fussy fellow takes it into his head that he will go on a
little tour, he pockets a few dollars and a clean dickey or
two, and&mdash;comes to town. He's no green horn&mdash;O! no, he
ain't, he has been around some&mdash;he has, and knows a thing
or two, and something over. He is dumped out of the
cars with hundreds of others, in the great depots, and is
assailed by vociferous <i>whips</i> who, in quest of stray dimes,
watch the incoming <i>trains</i> and shout and bawl&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eh 'up! Tremont House!"</p>

<p>"Up&mdash;<i>a!</i> American House&mdash;right away!"</p>

<p>"Ha! <i>up!</i> Right off for the Revere!"</p>

<p>"Here's the coach&mdash;already for the United States!"</p>

<p>"Yee 'up! now we go, git in, best house in town, all
ready for the Winthrop House!"</p>

<p>"Eh 'up, <i>ha!</i> now we are off, for the Pavilion!"</p>

<p>"Exchange Coffee House&mdash;dollar a day, four meals, no
extra charge&mdash;right along this way, sir!"</p>

<p>"Hoo-<i>ray</i>, this coach&mdash;take you right up, Exchange Hotel!"</p>

<p>"Jump in, tickets for your baggage, sir, take you up&mdash;right
off, best house in town, hot supper waitin'&mdash;way for
the Adams House!"</p>

<p>And so they yell and grab at you, and our fussy friend,
having heard of the tall arrangements and great doings of
the <i>American</i>, he hands himself over to the coachman, and
with a load of others he is rolled over to that institution,
in a jiffy. Our fussy friend is slightly "took down" at the
idea of paying for the hauling up, having a notion that that
was a part of the accommodation! However, he ain't a
going to look small or verdant; so he pays the coachman,
grabs his valise, and rushes into the long colonnaded office;
and making his way to the <i>register</i>, slams down his baggage,
and in a dignified, authoritative manner, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"A room!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responds the Colonel, or some of the clerks&mdash;who
may be officiating.</p>

<p>"Supper!" says Capt. Fussy, in the same tone of command.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir&mdash;please register your name, sir!"</p>

<p>Captain Fussy off's gloves, seizes the pen, and down
goes his autograph, Captain Fussy, Thumperstown, N. H.</p>

<p>"Now, I want a hot steak!" says he.</p>

<p>"You can have it, sir!" blandly replies the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Hot chocolate," continues Fussy.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir!"</p>

<p>"Eggs, poached, and a&mdash;hot roll!"</p>

<p>"They'll be all ready, sir."</p>

<p>"How soon?"</p>

<p>"Five minutes, sir," says the Colonel, talking to a dozen
at the same time.</p>

<p>"Ah, well&mdash;show me my room!" says Captain Fussy.</p>

<p>The bells are ringing&mdash;servants running to and fro, like
witches in a whirlwind; fifty different calls&mdash;tastes&mdash;orders
and fancies, are being served, but Capt. Fussy is attended
to, a servant seizes his valise and a taper, and in the most
winning way, cries&mdash;</p>

<p>"This way, sir, <i>right along!</i>" With a measured tread and
the air of a man who knew what it was all about, the Captain
follows the <i>garcon</i> and mounts one flight of the broad
stairs, and is about to ascend another, when it strikes him
that he's not going up to the top of the house, nohow!</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take me to&mdash;up into the garret?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, sir; your room's only 182; that's only on the
third floor!"</p>

<p>"Third floor!" cries Capt. Fussy, "take <i>me</i> up into the
third story?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of gentlemen on the fifth and sixth floors, sir,"
says the servant, and he goes ahead, Capt. Fussy following, muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pooty doin's this, taking a <i>gentleman</i> up three of these
cussed long stairs, to room 182! I'll see about this, I will;
mus'n't come no gammon over me; I'm able to pay, and
want the worth of my money!"</p>

<p>The third floor is reached, and after a brief meandering
along the halls, 182 is arrived at, the door thrown open and
Capt. Fussy is ushered in; his first effort is to find fault with
the carpets, furniture, bedding or something, but as he had
never probably seen such a general arrangement for ease,
comfort and convenience&mdash;he caved in and merely gave a
deep-toned&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Ah.</i> Got better rooms than this, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"There may be, sir, a few better rooms in the house, not
many," said the servant.</p>

<p>"Well, you may go&mdash;but stop&mdash;how soon'll my supper
be ready?"</p>

<p>"There'll be a supper set at eight, another at nine, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, four minutes of eight," says Fussy, pulling out a
"bull's eye" watch, with as much flourish as if it was a
premium eighteen-<i>carat lever</i>. "Well, call me when you've
got supper ready, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but you'll hear the gong."</p>

<p>"The gong&mdash;what's that? Ain't you got no bells?"</p>

<p>"The gong is used, sir, instead of bells," says the servant.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah</i>, well, clear out&mdash;but say, I want a fire in here."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'll send up a fireman."</p>

<p>"A fireman? What do I want with <i>firemen</i>? Bring in
some wood, and, stranger&mdash;start up&mdash;a hello! thunder and
saw mills, what's all that racket about&mdash;house a-fire?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir!</i>" says the grinning servant&mdash;"the <i>gong</i>&mdash;supper's
on the table!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ah</i>, very well; go ahead; where's the room?"</p>

<p>Conducted to the dining-room, Capt. Fussy's eyes stretch
at the wholesale display of table-cloths, arm-chairs, "crockery"
and cutlery, mirrors and white-aproned waiters. A
seat is offered him, he dumps himself down, amazed but determined
to look and act like one used to these affairs, from
the hour of his birth!</p>

<p>"I ordered hot steak, poached eggs&mdash;hain't you got 'em?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir!" says the waiter, and the steak and eggs
are at hand.</p>

<p>"Coffee or tea, sir?" another servant inquires.</p>

<p>"Coffee and tea! Humph, I ordered chocolate&mdash;hain't
you got chocolate?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; there it is."</p>

<p>"<i>Ah</i>, umph!" and Fussy gazes around and turns his nose
slightly up, at the whole concern, waiters, guests, table, steak,
eggs, chocolate, and&mdash;even the tempting hot rolls&mdash;before him.</p>

<p>Fussy calls for a glass of water, wants to know if there's
fried oysters on the table; he finds there is not, and Fussy
frowns and asks for a lobster salad, which the waiter informs
him is never used at supper, in that hotel.</p>

<p>Eventually, Capt. Fussy being <i>crammed</i>, after an hour's
diligent feeding, fuss and feathers, retires, asks all sorts of
questions about people and places, at the <i>office</i>; what time
trains start and steamers come, omnibuses here and stages
there, all of which he is politely answered, of course, and
he finally goes to his room, rings his bell every ten minutes,
for an hour, and then&mdash;goes to bed; next day puts the servants
and clerks over another course, and on the third day&mdash;calls
for his bill, finds but few extras charged, hands over
a <i>five</i>, puts on his gloves, seizes his valise, looks savagely
dignified and stalks out, big as two military officers in regimentals!</p>

<p>"<i>Ah</i>," says Fussy, as he reaches the street, "<i>I</i> put 'em
through&mdash;<i>I guess I got the worth of my money!</i>"</p>

<p>We calculate he did!</p>

<p>Old Gunter was going home t'other night with a very

accused the pavements of being icy, and down he came&mdash;<i>kerchug!</i>
A "young lady" coming along, fidgetting and

seeing Gunter feeling the ground, and making abortive
attempts to "riz." Gunter's gallantry was "up;" he knew
his own weakness, and saw the difficulty with the "young

<h2><a name="Quartering_upon_Friends" id="Quartering_upon_Friends"></a>Quartering upon Friends.</h2>


<p>City-bred people have a pious horror of the country
in winter, and no great regard for country visitors
at any time, however much they may "let on" to the contrary.</p>

<p>In rushing hot weather, when the bricks and mortar, the
stagnated, oven-like air of the crowded city threatens to
bake, parboil, or give the "citizens" the yellow fever, then
we are very apt to think of plain Aunt Polly, rough-hewed
Uncle John, and the bullet-headed, uncombed,
smock-frocked cousins, nephews, and nieces, at their rural
homes, amid the fragrant meadows and umbrageous woods;
the cool, silver streams and murmuring brooks of the glorious
country. Then, the poetic sunbeams and moonshine of
fancy bring to the eye and heart all or a part of the glories
and beauties, uses and purposes in which God has invested
the ruraldom.</p>

<p>Now, our country friends are mostly desirous, candidly
so, to have their city friends come and see them&mdash;not
merely pop visits, but bring your whole family, and stay a
month! This they may do, and will do, and can afford it,
as it is more convenient to one's pocket-book, on a farm,
to <i>quarter</i> a platoon of your friends than to perform the
same operation in the city, where it is apt to give your
purse the tick-dollar-owe in no time.</p>

<p>It was not long since, during the prevalence of a hot
summer, that Mrs. Triangle one morning said to her stewing
husband, who was in no wise troubled with a surplus of
the circulating medium&mdash;</p>

<p>"Triangle, it's on-possible for us to keep the children
well and quiet through this dreadful hot weather. We
must go into the country. The Joneses and Pigwigginses
and Macwackinses, and&mdash;and&mdash;everybody has gone out into
the country, and we must go, too; why can't we?"</p>

<p>"Why can't we?" mechanically echoed Triangle, who
just then was deeply absorbed in a problem as to whether
or not, considering the prices of coal, potatoes, house-rents,
leather, and "dry goods," he would fetch up in prison
or the poor-house first! It was a momentous question,
and to his wife's proposal of a fresh detail of domestic expense,
Triangle responded&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why can't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I'd like to know&mdash;why can't <i>we</i>?"</p>

<p>"We <i>can't</i>, Mrs. Triangle," decidedly answered her lord
and master.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. T., being but a woman, very naturally went
on to give Mr. T. a Caudle lecture half an hour long,
winding up with one of those time-honored perquisites of
the female sex&mdash;a good cry.</p>

<p>Poor Triangle put on his hat and marched down to his
bake-oven of an "office," to plan business and smoke his
cigar. Triangle came home to tea, and saw at a glance
that something must be done. Mrs. Triangle was to be
"compromised," or far hotter than even the hot, hot weather
would be his domicile for the balance of the season.
Triangle thought it over, as he nibbled his toast and sipped
his hot Souchong.</p>

<p>"My dear," said he, pushing aside his cup, and tilting
himself upon the "hind legs" of his chair&mdash;"business is
very dull, the weather is intolerable, I know you and the
children would be much benefitted by a trip into the country&mdash;why
can't we go?"</p>

<p>"Why can't we?&mdash;that's what I'd like to know!" was
the ready response of Mrs. T.</p>

<p>"Well, we can go. My friend Jingo has as fine a place
in the country as ever was, anywhere; he has asked me
again and again to come down in the summer, and bring
all the family. Now we'll go; Jingo will be delighted
to see us; and we'll have a good, pleasant time, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>Mrs. Triangle was delighted; soon all the clouds of her
temper were dispersed, and like people "cut out for each
other," Triangle and his wife sat and planned the details
of the tour to Jingo Hill Farm. Frederic Antonio Gustavus
was to be rigged out in new boots, hat, and breeches.
Maria Evangeline Roxana Matilda was to be fitted
out in Polka boots, gipsey bonnet, and Bloomer pantalettes,
with an entire invoice of handkerchiefs, scarfs, ribbons,
gloves, and hosiery for "mother," little Georgiana
Victorine Rosa Adelaide, and <i>the baby</i>, Henry Rinaldo
Mercutio. After three days' onslaught upon poor Triangle's
pockets, with any quantity of "fuss and feathers,"
Mrs. Triangle pronounced the caravan ready to move. But
just as all was ready, Bridget Durfy, the maid-of-all-work,
who was to accompany them on the expedition as supervisor
of the children, threw up her engagement.</p>

<p>"Plaze the pigs," said Biddy; "it's mesilf as niver likes
the counthry, at all; an' I'll jist be afther not goin', ma'm,
wid yez!"</p>

<p>Here was a go&mdash;or rather a "no go!" Triangle had
bought tickets for all, and ordered the carriage at four;
it was now three P. M., of a hot, roasting day. It would
be "on-possible," as Mrs. T. said, to go without a girl; so
poor, sweltering Triangle rushed down to the "Intelligence
Office," where, from the sweating mass of female humanity
awaiting a market for their time and labor, Triangle selected
a stout, hearty Irish <i>blonde</i>, warranted perfect, capable,
kind, honest, and the Lord only knows how many virtues
the keeper of an "Intelligence Office" will not swear belong
to one of their stock in trade.</p>

<p>Away went Triangle, sweating and swearing; the Irish
maiden, swinging a bundle in one hand and a flaring <i>bandanna</i>
in the other, following after her patron with a duck-waddle;
and finally the carriage came; all got in but Triangle,
who started on foot to the depot, carrying his double-barrelled
gun and leading an ugly dog, which he rejoiced
in believing was a full-blooded <i>setter</i>, though the best posted
dog-fanciers assured him it was a cross between a tan-yard
cur and a sheep-stealer! But, after a world of motion and
commotion&mdash;on the part of Triangle, about the dog, tickets
and baggage, and Mrs. Triangle, about the children, satchels,
her new gown, and the sleepy Irish girl&mdash;they found
themselves whisked over the rails, and after some three
hours' carriage, they were dumped down in the vicinity of
Jingo Hall, where they found the "private conveyance"
of the proprietor of Jingo Hill Farm waiting to carry
them, bandbox and bundle, rag-tag and bobtail, to Jingo Hall.</p>

<p>The carriage being overfull, Triangle concluded to walk
up, stretch his legs, try his dog and gun, and have a pop
at the game. But, alas, for the villanous dog; no sooner
had he got loose and scampered off up the road, than he
sees a flock of sheep some distance across the fields, and
away he pitched. The sheep ran, he after the sheep; and
poor Triangle after his dog.</p>

<p>"Hay! you Ponto&mdash;here&mdash;hay&mdash;Ponto-o-o! Hey, boy,
come here, you dog&mdash;hi! hi!&mdash;do you hear-r-r?"</p>

<p>But Ponto was off, and after a run of half a mile, he
came up with a lamb, and before Triangle could come to
the rescue, Ponto had opened the campaign by killing
sheep! Triangle was so put out about it that in wrath
he up with his gun and was about to terminate the existence
of the dog, but compromised the matter by hitting
him a whack across the back with the barrels of his shooting-iron;
in doing so, he broke off the stock, clean as a
<a id='Pg_169' name='Pg_169'></a>
whistle! It is useless to deny that Triangle <i>was</i> mad;
that he swore equal to an Erie Canal boatman; and that
his fury so alarmed the dog that he took to his heels and
went&mdash;as Triangle hoped&mdash;anywhere, head foremost.</p>

<p>With a face as long as a boot-jack, quite tuckered out
and disgusted with things as far as he had got, Triangle
reached Jingo Hall, where he met the warm welcome of
his friend, Major Jingo, and soon recuperated his good
humor and physical activity by the contents of the Major's
"well-stocked" <i>wine-cellar</i>. Ashamed of the facts of the
case, Triangle trumped up a cock-and-bull story about the
dog and gun.</p>

<p>After a season, the Triangles got settled away, and the
first day or two passed without anything extraordinary
turning up, if we may except the upturning of several
flower-pots and hen's nests by the children. But the third
day opened ominously. Triangle's dog was found with one
of the Major's dead lambs under convoy, and the Irish
hostler had caught him, tied him up in the stable, and given
him such a dressing that Ponto's soul-case was nearly beaten
out of him!</p>

<p>The next item was a yowl in the garden! Everybody
rushed out&mdash;Mrs. Triangle in her excitement, lest something
had happened to "baby," and Nora, the girl, struck the
centre-table, upset the "Astral," and not only demolished
that ancient piece of furniture, but spilled enough thick oil
over the gilt-edged literature, table-cloth, and carpet, to
make a barrel of soft soap.</p>

</div>

<p>The Irish girl came bounding, screeching forth! She
had been sauntering through the garden, and ran against
the bee-hives, when a bee up and at her. With a presence
of mind truly unparalleled, she laid down "baby" upon the
grass, and made fight with "the spiteful craturs;" and of
course she got her hands full, was beset by tens and hundreds,
and was stung in as many places by the pugnacious
"divils." Nora was done for. She went to bed; "baby"
was found all right, laughing "fit to break its yitty hearty
party, at naughty Nora Dory," as Mrs. Triangle very naturally
expressed it.</p>

<p>These two tableaux had hardly reached their climax,
when in rushed Frederic Antonio Gustavus, with his capacious
apron full of "birds he killed in the yard, down by
the barns." Poor Jingo! and we may add, poor Mrs.
Jingo! for a favorite brood of the finest fowls in the
country had been exterminated by the chivalrous young
Triangle, and in the bloom of his heroic act he dropped the
dead game at the feet of his horror-stricken mother, and
astonished father, and the Jingos.</p>

<p>That night the effect of stuffing with green fruit to utter
suffocation manifested itself in a general and alarming
cholera-morbus among the junior Triangles, and the whole
house was up in arms.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, a fresh clamor broke out in Nora's
chamber. A huge bat had got into her room, and so
alarmed her, that she yelled worse, louder, and longer than
seven evil ones.</p>

<p>It was a night of horror to the whole family&mdash;to everybody
in and about Jingo Hall. The dogs set up a howl;
the children bawled, cried, and took on; the Irish girl
screeched; gin and laudanum, peppermint and "lollypops,"
the de'il to pay and no pitch hot.</p>

<p>Triangle felt relieved when daylight came, and had it not
been Sunday, he would have packed up and put back for
the prosy office and stagnated quietude of the city. But it
was Sunday, and after the children, Irish girl, and dogs had
been partially quieted, down the carriage came to the door,
and as many as could get into it of the Jingos and Triangles,
rolled off to meeting.</p>

<p>Triangle and Jingo went to escape the din and noise of
dressing "the babies," &amp;c.; and after the service was
over, poor Triangle was taken aside by a tall, bony man,
who reported himself in no very ceremonious manner as the
proprietor of a flock of sheep scared to death, and one rare
lamb killed&mdash;"by your dog!" Triangle owned to the soft
impeachment, and "compromised" for a V.</p>

<p>Returned to Jingo Hall, another <i>coup d'etat</i> all around
the lot had broken out. Evangeline Roxana Matilda Triangle
had disappeared. The baby, Georgiana Victorine
Rosa Adelaide, had fallen from a swing in the grove and
dislocated her wrist, and flattened her pretty nose quite to
her pretty face. Baby was very ill, and from the groans
issuing from Nora's attic, it was not <i>on-possible</i> that she
was sick as she could be. A general search took place for
Evangeline Roxana Matilda, while Maj. Jingo mounted a
horse and rode over to the village, to bring down a doctor
for Georgiana Victorine Rosa Adelaide, "the baby," and&mdash;Nora Dougherty.</p>

<p>A glance at the Irish girl convinced poor <i>tried</i> Triangle
that she was a case&mdash;of small-pox.</p>

<p>Maj. Jingo returned, but without a medical adviser; the
village Esculapius having gone off to the city. Things
looked gloomy enough. Triangle felt "chawed up," and
wished he had been roasted alive in the city before venturing
upon such a trip. But he felt he had a duty to perform,
and he determined to put it through.</p>

<p>"Major, I'm very sorry, but the fact is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind, my dear fellow&mdash;no trouble
to us."</p>

<p>"But," chokingly continued poor Triangle, "but, Major,
the fact is, I&mdash;a&mdash;you've got a large family"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear boy; don't say any more
about it."</p>

<p>"But to have the&mdash;a&mdash;the&mdash;small-pox"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What?" gasped the Major&mdash;"the&mdash;a"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Small-pox!" seriously enough responded Triangle.</p>

<p>"Small-pox! Who? Where?"</p>

<p>"Our Irish girl&mdash;up stairs&mdash;awful!"</p>

<p>"O, good Lord! Irish&mdash;up stairs&mdash;small-pox!" reiterated
the really alarmed proprietor of Jingo Hall.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have"&mdash;said Triangle.</p>

<p>"The small-pox in my house"&mdash;echoed Jingo.</p>

<p>"For all the blessed countries in the world!" passionately
exclaimed Triangle.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" exclaimed the Major; "my wife has a
greater dread of small-pox than yellow fever, or death itself!"</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" said poor Triangle.</p>

<p>"Remove the girl to an out-house, instantly!" said the
Major, pacing up and down, in great <i>furore</i>.</p>

<p>"That's best, Major; go move her, at once."</p>

<p>"Me? Me move her, sir?" said Jingo.</p>

<p>"Why who will, Major?" responded Triangle.</p>

<p>"Who? Why, you, of course."</p>

<p>"Me?" exclaimed Triangle&mdash;"me? endanger my life,
and the lives of all my family&mdash;me? No, sir, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll
be hanged if I do!"</p>

<p>"Blur a' nouns, zur!" bawled the Irish hostler, as he
came trotting up to the front veranda, where Triangle and
Jingo were discussing the transportation of small-pox&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blur a' nouns&mdash;the dog's loose!"</p>

<p>"Curse the dog!" said the Major.</p>

<p>"But, zur, it's raving mad, he is!"</p>

<p>"Mad! my dog?" cries Triangle.</p>

<p>"A mad dog, too!" exclaims the Major, in horror.</p>

<p>"O, too bad&mdash;horrible&mdash;wish I'd never seen"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get your gun, quick&mdash;come on!" cried the Major.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Major, my gun's broke all to smash. O!
that I had shot the blasted brute instead of breaking my gun!"</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;never mind&mdash;seize a club, fork, or anything,
and hunt around for the cursed dog. He'll bite some of
our people, horses, or cattle." And away ran the Major,
with a bit of stick about the size of a fence-rail. Paddy
made himself scarce, and Triangle, in agony, flew around to
hunt up his daughter, whom they found asleep in a summer-house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Major Jingo, when she heard that the Irish girl had
introduced the small-pox on Jingo Hill, liked to have fainted
away; but, conquering her weakness, she ordered the
carriage, and bundled herself and four children into it, so
full of terror and alarm that she never so much as said&mdash;"Take
care of yourself, Mrs. Triangle!" Maj. Jingo returned,
after a fruitless search for Triangle's mad dog, and
just as he entered the hall, the Irish girl came rushing down
stairs, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"O! murther, murther! I'm dead as a door-nail,
entirely, wid dese pains in my face. Be gorra! O, murther!"</p>

<p>One look at the swollen and truly frightful face of the
girl put the Major to his <i>taps</i>; and stopping but a moment
to tell Triangle to make out the best he could, he left.</p>

<p>Next morning, bag and baggage, the Triangles <i>vamosed</i>.
The poor girl having recovered from her attack of the bees,
which had led to the alarm of small-pox, looked quite respectable.
Never did a party enjoy <i>home</i> more completely
than the Triangles after that. Triangle has a holy horror
of trips to the country, and the Jingos are down on visitors
from the city.</p>

<h2><a name="Jake_Hinkles_Failings" id="Jake_Hinkles_Failings"></a>Jake Hinkle's Failings.</h2>


<p>In the village of Washington, Fayette Co., Ohio, there
was a transient sort of a personage, a kind of floating
farmer, named Hinkle,&mdash;Jacob Hinkle,&mdash;commonly called
<i>Old Jake Hinkle</i>. Jake was, originally, a Dutchman, a
Pennsylvania, Lancaster County Dutchman; and that was
about <i>as</i> Dutch as Holland and Sour Krout could well
make a human "critter." Well, Jake Hinkle owned, or
had squatted on, a small patch of land, just beyond old
Mother Rodger's "bottom," that is, about a mile east of
the "Rattle Snake Fork" of Paint Creek, which, every
thundering fool out West knows, empties itself into&mdash;"Big
Paint," which finally rolls out into the Muskingum, and
thence into the Ohio. Very well, having settled the geographical
position of Jake Hinkle, let me go on to state
what kind of a critter Jake was, and how it came about
that he was pronounced dead, one cold morning, and how
he came up to town and denied the assertion.</p>

<p>Jake Hinkle loved corn, lived on it, as most people do
in the interior of Ohio and Kentucky; he loved <i>corn</i>, but
loved corn whiskey more, and this love, many a time,
brought Jake up to "the Court House" of Washington,
through rain, hail and snow, to get a nipper, fill his jug,
and go home. Now, in the West it is a custom more
honored in the breach than in the observance, perhaps, for
grog shops of the village to play all sorts of fantastic tricks
upon old codgers who come up to town, or down to town,
hitch their horses to the fence, and there let the "critters"
stand, from 10 A. M. to 12 P. M., more or less, and longer.
The most popular dodge is, to shave the horse's tail, turn
it loose, and let it go home. Of course, <i>that</i> horse is not
soon seen in the village again, as a horse with a shored tail is
about the meanest thing to look at, except a singed possum,
or a dandy&mdash;you ever did see.</p>

<p>One very cold night, in January, '39, Jake Hinkle came
down to the "Court House," hitched his horse to the
Court Square fence, and made a straight bend for Sanders'
"Grocery," and began to "wood up." Old Jake's tongue
was a perfect bell-clapper, and when well oiled with corn
juice, could rip into the high and low Dutch like a nor'easter
into a field of broom corn. Jake talked and talked,
and drank and talked, and about midnight, the cocks crowing,
the stars winking and blinking, and the wind nipping
and whistling around the grocery, Sanders notified Jake
and others that he was going to shut up the concern, and
the crowd must be "putting out." Jake made a break for
his nag, but she was gone. "Why," says Jake, "she's
broke der pridle and gone home, and by skure I shall
walk,"&mdash;and off Jake put, through the cold and mud.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the Circleville stage came along
between old Marm Rodger's "bottom," and the Rattle
Snake Fork of Paint, the driver discovered poor old Jake
laid out, stiff and cold as a wedge! Alas, poor old Jake!
Gone! Quite a gloom hung over the "grocery;" Jake
was an inoffensive, good old fellow, nobody denied that,
and certain young "fellers" who had shaved the tail of
Jake's mare the night previous, and set her loose, now felt
sort of sorry for the deed. The editor of the "Argus of
Freedom" came down to the "grocery," to get his morning
"nip," heard the news, went back to his office, "set up"
Jake's obituary notice, pitched in a few sorrowful phrases,
and then put his paper to press; that afternoon, the whole
edition, of some two hundred copies, were distributed
around among the subscribers and "dead heads," and Jake
Hinkle was pronounced stone dead&mdash;<i>pegged out!</i></p>

<p>Two or three days afterwards, a man covered with mud
and sweat, came rushing into Washington. He paused not,
nor turned not right or left, until he found the office of the
"Argus of Freedom," where he rushed in, and confronting
the editor, he spluttered forth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You der printer of dish paper,&mdash;der noosh paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says the 'responsible,' "I am the man," looking
a little wild.</p>

<p>"Vell, bine de great Jehosaphat, what for you'n make
me deat?"</p>

<p>"Me? Make you dead?" says the no little astonished editor.</p>

<p>"Yaas!" bawled old Jake, for it was he&mdash;"You'n tell
de people I diet; <i>it's a lie!</i> And do you neber do it
again, and fool de peeples, <i>witout you git a written order
from me!</i>"</p>

<p>That editor, ever afterwards, insisted on seeing the
funeral before he recorded an obituary notice.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Washerwomans_Windfall" id="The_Washerwomans_Windfall"></a>The Washerwoman's Windfall.</h2>


<p>Some years ago, there lived, dragged and toiled, in one
of our "Middle States," or Southern cities, and old
lady, named Landon, the widow of a lost sea captain; and
as a dernier resort, occurring in many such cases, with a
family of children to provide for,&mdash;the father and husband
cut off from life and usefulness, leaving his family but a
stone's cast from indigence,&mdash;the mother, to keep grim
poverty from famishing her hearth and desolating her home,
took in gentlemen's washing. Her eldest child, a boy of
some twelve years old, was in the habit of visiting the
<ins title="lagest">largest</ins> hotels in the city, where he received the finer pieces
of the gentlemen's apparel, and carried them to his mother.
They were done up, and returned by the lad again.</p>

<p>It was in mid-winter, cold and dreary season for the
poor&mdash;travel was slack, and few and far between were the
poor widow's receipts from her drudgery.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said the widow, as she sat musing by her
small fire, "to-morrow is Saturday; I have not a stick of
wood, pound of meal, nor dollar in the world, to provide
food or warmth for my children over Sunday."</p>

<p>"But, mother," responded her 'main prop,' George, the
eldest boy, "that gentleman who gave me the half dollar
for going to the bank for him, last week,&mdash;you know him
we washed for at the United States Hotel,&mdash;said he was to
be here again to-morrow. I was to call for his clothes; so
I will go, mother, to-morrow; maybe he will have another
errand for me, or some money&mdash;he's got so much money in
his trunk!"</p>

<p>"So, indeed, you said, good child; it's well you thought
of it," said the poor woman.</p>

<p>Next day the lad called at the hotel, and sure enough,
the strange gentleman had arrived again. He appeared
somewhat bothered, but quickly gathering up some of his
soiled clothes, gave them to the lad, and bade him tell his
mother to wash and return them that evening by all means.</p>

<p>"Alas! that I cannot do," said the widow, as her son
delivered the message. "My dear child, I have neither fire
to dry them, nor money to procure the necessary fuel."</p>

<p>"Shall I take the clothes back again, mother, and tell
the gentleman you can't dry them in time for him?"</p>

<p>"No, son. I must wash and dry them&mdash;we must have
money to-day, or we'll freeze and starve&mdash;I must wash and
dry these clothes," said the disconsolate widow, as she immediately
went about the performance, while her son started
to a neighboring coopering establishment, to get a basket
of chips and shavings to make fire sufficient to dry and iron
the clothes.</p>

<p>The clothes were duly tumbled into a great tub of water,
and the poor woman began her manipulations. After a
time, in handling a vest, the widow felt a knot of something
in the breast pocket. She turned the pocket, and out fell
a little mass of almost pulpy paper. She carefully unrolled
the saturated bunch&mdash;she started&mdash;stared; the color from
her wan cheeks went and came! Her two little children,
observing the wild looks and strange actions of the mother,
ran to her, screaming:</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;dear mother! Mother, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Hush-h-h!" said she; "run, dear children&mdash;lock the
door&mdash;lock the door! no, no, never mind. I a&mdash;I a&mdash;feel&mdash;dizzy!"</p>

<p>The alarmed children clung about the mother's knees in
great affright, but the widow, regaining her composure,
told them to sit down and play with their little toys, and
not mind her. The cause of this sudden emotion was the
unrolling of five five hundred dollar bills. They were very
wet&mdash;nearly "used up," in fact&mdash;but still significant of
vast, astounding import to the poor and friendless woman.
She was amazed&mdash;honor and poverty were struggling in
her breast. Her poverty cried out, "You are made up&mdash;rich&mdash;wash
no more&mdash;fly!" But then the poor woman's
honor, more powerful than the tempting wealth in her
hands&mdash;triumphed! She laid the wet notes in a book,
and again set about her washing.</p>

<p>About this time, quite a different scene was being enacted
at the hotel. The gentleman so anxious that his
clothes should be returned that evening, was no other than
a famous counterfeiter and forger; and it happened, that
the day previous, in a neighboring city, he had committed
a forgery, drawn some four or five thousand dollars, had
the greater part of the notes exchanged&mdash;and, with the
exception of the five large bills hurriedly thrust into the
vest pocket, and which he had sent to the poor laundress,
there was little available evidence of the forgery in his possession.
The widow's son had scarcely left the traveller's
room with the clothes, when in came two policemen. The
forger was not arrested as a principal, but certain barely
suspicious circumstances had led to an investigation of him
and his effects.</p>

<p>"You are our prisoner, sir!" said one of the policemen,
as a servant opened the door to let them in.</p>

<p>"Me! What for?" was the quick response of the forger.</p>

<p>"That you will learn in due season; at present we wish
to examine your person and effects."</p>

<p>The forger started&mdash;his heart beat with the rapidity of
galvanic pulsation&mdash;the evidence of part of his villany was,
as he supposed, among his effects. It was a moment of
terror to him, but it passed like a flash, and in a gay and
careless tone, he quickly replied:</p>

<p>"O, very well, gentlemen&mdash;go ahead. There are my
keys and baggage&mdash;search, and look around. I have no
idea what you are after&mdash;probably you'll find." In a low
tone, he continued, to himself, "By heavens, how lucky!
that boy has saved me!"</p>

<p>A considerable amount of money was found upon the
forger, but none that could be identified, and after a long
and wearisome private examination at the police court, he
was discharged. He returned to the hotel, and shortly
afterwards the lad made his appearance with the clothes,
presenting him with a small roll of damp paper, saying:</p>

<p>"Here, sir, is something mother found in one of your
pockets. She thinks it may be valuable to you, sir, and
she is sorry it was wet."</p>

<p>The forger started, as though the little roll of wet money
had been a serpent the lad was holding towards him.</p>

<p>"No, no, my little man; return it to your mother; tell
her to dry it carefully, and that I will call and see her to-night,
when she can return the little parcel."</p>

<p>George stood, his cap in one hand, and the other upon
the door-knob; the man was much agitated, and perceiving
the lad lingered, he thrust his hand into a carpet-bag, and
hauling forth an old-fashioned wallet, he opened it, and taking
thence a coin, put it in the hands of the lad and requested him
to run home to his mother and deliver the message immediately.
The lad did as he was ordered; and the poor washerwoman,
the while, sat in her humble and ill-provided home,
patiently awaiting the return of her boy, and fearing the anger
of the gentleman at the hotel, when he should find his bank
notes nearly, if not quite destroyed, would probably so indispose
him towards the child that he would return empty-handed.
But no; as the quick tread of the blithesome
lad smote upon the widow's ear, she rushed to the door to
receive him.</p>

<p>"Dear son, was the gentleman very angry?"</p>

<p>"Angry, dear mother? No! he was far from angry.
He said you must dry these papers, and he would call
to-night for them. And here, dear mother, he gave me a
large piece of beautiful yellow money!" And the dutiful
boy placed a golden doubloon in the trembling hand of
the overjoyed mother. They were saved&mdash;the golden coin
soon made the widow's domicil cheerful and happy.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to say, the five notes were not called
for. They laid in the widow's bureau drawer two entire
years, when a friend to the poor woman negotiated for
their exchange into a dwelling-house and small store.
And to this little incident does a certain elderly lady and
her family owe their present prosperous and perfectly
honorable position in the respectable society of the city of &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

soldier the world ever saw, the British army was cut down,
rank and file&mdash;Napoleon having promised to "be a good
boy," and let 'em alone in future. Among the <i>cut offs</i>,
was a troop of horse, and in this troop was an old veteran
Bucephalus, who had stood and made charges, smelt fire
and brimstone, faced phalanxes of bayonets, and clashed
rough-shod over many bloody fields, besides Waterloo,&mdash;this
old fellow was turned out to grass&mdash;cashiered. When
the balance of his retained companions in saddle were
leaving the town where the dismemberment had taken
place, the old war horse was quietly grazing in a field; the
troop passed&mdash;the bugler "sounded his horn," and in less
than forty winks the old old horse was up, off, over fences,
and in the front ranks! The tenacity with which he clung
to his place in the column caused&mdash;says the historian&mdash;the
officers and men to shed tears.</p>

<p>So much by way of a prelude. Now for old Maguire
and his horse. Some years ago, in the interior of Ohio,
there did live an old Irish jintleman, who not only had a
fine estate, but likewise a saw-mill, and as fine an old black
mare as ever the rays of a noonday's sun lit down upon.
"Bonny Doon," Maguire's old mare, was a wonderful
"critter;" she opened gates, let down bars, seized the pump
handle by her teeth, and actually extracted water from the
barn-yard well, with all the facility of a regular double-fisted
<i>genus homo</i>. As a sly old joker, she had performed various
tricks, such as nipping off the tails of sucking calves,
catching chickens in her manger, and making various pieces
of them, and kicking in the ribs of strange dogs and horned
cattle. But to the eccentric habits and bacchanalian
customs of her ex-military master, the old mare's dormant
talents owed their "fetching out."</p>

<p>Old "Captain Maguire" had served with credit to himself
and honor to the State, in her early struggles against
the Indians and French Canadians. "Bonny Doon" was
then in her "fille"-hood, and probably the most beautiful,
as well as the most saucy jade, in the frontier army. Some
twenty-five years had passed, and still the old captain and
the mare were about, every-day cronies, for the old man
no more thought of walking fifty rods, premeditatedly, than
a South Carolina dandy would dream of the possibility of
getting a glass of water without the immediate assistance
of a son of Ethiopia! The old man had become possessed
of wealth as well as years&mdash;was likewise the progenitor
of a large and flourishing family, of the finest looking men
and women in the State, and having gotten all things in
this pleasant kind of train, he "laid off" in perfect lavender.
The old captain's farm was about four miles from the
large and flourishing town of Z&mdash;&mdash;, and here the captain
spent most of his time. Riding in on "Bonny Doon," in
the morning, and hitching her to the sign-post, the poor
beast would stand there&mdash;unless taken in by the ostler or
others&mdash;until midnight, while the captain swigged whiskey,
and smoked his pipe in the tavern. Yet "Bonny Doon's"
affection for her old master did not flag; she waited patiently
until he came&mdash;her mane and long tail would then
switch about, while she'd "snigger eout" with gladness at
his coming, and carry the old man through rain or snow,
moonshine, or total darkness, over corduroy railroads,
bridges, ravines, and last, though by no means least, over
the narrow plank-way of Captain Maguire's saw-mill dam,
while the waters on each side foamed and roared like a
mountain torrent, and while the old man was either asleep
or his hat so full of "bricks," that he was about as difficult
to balance in the saddle as a sack of potatoes or Turk's
Island salt! A better citizen, when sober, never paid
taxes or trod sole leather in that State, than old Captain
Maguire; but when he was "up the tree," a little sprung,
or <i>tight</i>, as you may say, he was ugly enough, and chock
full of wolf and brimstone! One day the captain was summoned
to attend court, and testify in a case wherein his
evidence was to give a lift to the suit of a neighbor, for
whom the old man entertained a most lively disgust and
very unchristianly hate. The old man, finding that he
must go, went. He wet his whistle several times before
starting, repeated the dose several times before he reached
the Court House, and about the time he supposed he was
wanted, he mounted "Bonny Doon," and started, full
chisel, up the steps, through the entry, and into the crowded
Court room, just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>"Robert Maguire! Robert Maguire! Robert&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be the help o' Moses, <i>I'm here!</i>" roared the captain,
in response to the crier.</p>

<p>And sure enough, he wasn't anywhere else! There he
sat, stiff, and formal as a bronze statue of some renowned
military chieftain, on a pot-metal war steed. Some laughed,
others stepped out of the way of the mare's heels, judge
and jury "riz," some of the oldest sinners in law practice
looked quite "skeery," doubtless taking the old captain
and his black charger for quite a different individual! It
was some time before order and decorum were restored,
as it was much easier for the judge to <i>order</i> Captain Maguire
to be arrested for his freak, than to do it, "Bonny
Doon" not being disposed to let any man approach her
head or heels. They shut the captain up, finally, for contempt
of court, and fined him twenty dollars, but he escaped
the disagreeable attitude of sustaining the suit of an
enemy. At another time, the captain, being on a <i>time</i>,
dashed into a meeting-house, running in at one door, and
slap bang out at the other! This feat of Camanche horsemanship
rather alarmed the whole congregation, and cost
the captain five twenties! Riding into bar rooms and
stores was a common performance of "Bonny Doon" and
her master; and he had even gone so far as to run the mare
up two entire flights of stairs of the principal hotel, dashing
into a room where "a native" was shivering in bed with
the fever and ague; but the noise and sudden appearance
of a man and horse in such high latitudes effected a permanent
and speedy cure; the fright like to have destroyed the
sufferer's crop of hair, but the "a-gy" was skeered clean
out of his emaciated body.</p>

<p>After a variety of adventures by flood and field, of hair-breadth
'scapes, and eccentricities of man and beast, they
parted! "Bonny Doon" being about the only living spectator
of her master's end. This tragic denouement came
about one cold, stormy and snowy night, when few men,
and as few beasts, would willingly or without pressing occasion,
expose themselves to the pitiless storm. The old
captain had been in town all day, with "Bonny Doon"
hitched to the horse block, and being full of "distempering
draughts," as Shakspeare modestly terms it, and malicious
bravery in the midst of the great storm, late in the evening
he mounted his half-starved and as near frozen mare, to go home.</p>

<p>"Better stay all night, captain," coaxed some friend.</p>

<p>"Hills are icy, and hollows filled with snow," suggested
the landlord.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't ride out to your place to-night, captain, for
a seat in Congress!" rejoined the first speaker.</p>

<p>"Ye wouldn't?" replied the captain. "And&mdash;and no
wonder ye wouldn't, fer not a divil iv ye's iver had the
horse as could carry ye's over me road th' night. Look at
that! There's the baste can do it!&mdash;d'ye see that?"
and as the old man, reeling in the saddle, jammed the rowels
of his heavy spurs into the flanks of the mare, she nearly
stood erect, and chafed her bits as fiery and mettled as
though just from her oats and warm stable, and fifteen years
kicked off.</p>

<p>"Boys," bawled the captain, "here's the ould mare that
can thravel up a frozen mountain, slide down a greased
rainbow, and carry ould Captain Maguire where the very
ould divil himsilf couldn't vinture his dirty ould body.
Hoo-o-oo-oop! I'm gone, boys!"</p>

<p>And he was off, gone, too; for the old man never
reached the threshold of his domicil.&mdash;Next morning Captain
Maguire was found in the mill-dam, entirely dead, with
poor "Bonny Doon," nearly frozen, and scarcely able to
walk or move, standing near him. But there she stood,
upon the narrow icy way over the dam, and from appearances
of the snow and planks of the little bridge, the faithful
mare had pawed, scraped, and endeavored by various
means to rescue her master. The manner of the catastrophe
was evident; the old man had become sleepy, and
frozen, and while the poor mare was feeling her way over
the icy and snow-covered bridge, her master had slipped
off into the frozen dam, and no doubt she would have
dragged him out, could she have reached him. As it was,
she stood a faithful sentinel over her lost master, and did
not survive him long,&mdash;the cold and her evident sorrow
ended the eventful life of "Bonny Doon."</p>

<h2><a name="the_Right_Pew" id="the_Right_Pew"></a>Getting into the "Right Pew."</h2>


<p>New Year's day is some considerable "pumpkins" in
many parts of the United States. In the Western
States, they have horse-racing, shooting-matches, quilting-frolics
and grand hunting parties. In the South, the week
beginning with Christmas and ending with New Year's day,
is devoted to the largest liberty by the negroes, who have
one grand and extensive <i>saturnalia</i>, visit their friends and
relations, make love to the "gals" on neighboring plantations,
spend the little change saved through the year, or
now and then given to them by indulgent or generous masters,
and in fact have a glorious good time! The holidays
in New Orleans, and in Louisiana generally, is <i>a time</i>, and
no mistake. The old French and Spanish families keep
open house&mdash;dinners and suppers, music, song and dance.
On New Year's eve, they decorate the graves of their friends
with flowers. Lamps or lanterns are often required for this
purpose, and as you pass the silent grave-yards, it is indeed
a novel sight to see the many glimmering lights about
the tombs of the departed. In most of the South-Western
towns, the day is given up to fun and frolic. The Philadelphians
have a great blow out. The streets are filled by
holiday-looking people, children with toys and "mint sticks"&mdash;making
the air resound with tin trumpets and penny
whistles. The men and boys used to load up every thing
in the shape of cannons, guns, pistols and hollow keys, and
bang away from sunset until sunrise, keeping up a racket,
din and uproar, equal to the bombardment of a citadel.
The authorities stopped that, and now the civil young men
kill the night and day in dancing, feasting, and attending
the amusements, the multitude of rowdies passing their time
in concocting and carrying on street fights and running with
the engines.</p>

<p>But the New Yorkers <i>bang</i> the whole of them; bear witness,
O ye New Year's doings I have there seen. Visiting
your friends, and your friends' friends. Open houses every
where! "Drop in and take a glass of wine or bit of cake,
if nothing else"&mdash;that's the word. Jeremy Diddlers flourish,
marriageable daughters and interesting widows set their
caps for the nice young men, the streets are noisy and full
of confusion, the theatres and show-shops generally reap an
elegant harvest, and the police reports of the second morning
of the New Year swell monstrously! Of a New Year's
adventure of an innocent young acquaintance of mine, I
have a little story to tell.</p>

<p>Jeff. Jones was caught, at a New Year's dinner in New
York, by the fascinating grace and <i>cap</i>-tivating head-gear
of a certain young widow, who had a fine estate. Jeff. was
what you might call a good boy; he had never seen much
of creation, save that lying between Pokeepsie (his birth-place)
and the Battery, Castle Garden and Bloomingdale.
He was a clever fellow, fond of rational fun and amusement,
kept "a set of books" for a mercantile firm in Maiden
Lane, dressed well, kept good hours, and in all general
respects, was&mdash;a nice young man. He went with a friend
on a tour&mdash;New Year's day, to make calls. After a number
of glasses and chunks of cake, feeling altogether beautiful,
he found himself in the presence of a charming widow, and
some two months afterwards, himself and the widow, a parson
and a brace of male and female friends, Jeff. Jones,
aged 28, took a partner for life, ergo he hung up his hat in
the snug domicil of the flourishing widow, who became
Mrs. Jeff. Jones, thereafter.</p>

<p>Poor Jeff., he found out that there was some truth in the
venerable saying&mdash;all is not gold that glitters. The charming
widow was seriously inclined to wear the inexpressibles;
and poor Jeff., being of such a gentlemanly, good and easy
disposition, scarcely made a struggle for his reserved rights.
However, things, under such a state of affairs, grew no
better fast, and as Jeff. Jones had neglected to go around
and see the elephant before marriage, he came to the conclusion
to see what was going on after that interesting ceremony.
In short, Jeff. got to going out of nights&mdash;kept
"bad hours," got blowed up in gentle strains at first, but
which were promised to be enlarged if Mr. Jones did not
mind his Ps. and Qs.</p>

<p>The third anniversary of Jeff. Jones's annexation to the
widow was coming around. It was New Year's day in the
morn; it brought rather sober reflections into Jeff.'s mind,
on the head of which he thought he'd as soon as not&mdash;<i>get
tight!</i> This notion was pleasing, and dressing himself in
his best clothes, Jones informed Mrs. J. that he wished to
call on a few old friends, and would be home to dine and
bring some friends with him!</p>

<p>"See that you do, then," said Mrs. J., "see that you do,
that's all!" and she gave Mr. J. "a look" not at all like Miss
Juliet's to Mr. Romeo&mdash;she <i>spoke</i>, and she said something.</p>

<p>However, Jones cleared himself; dinner hour arrived, if
Jeff. Jones did not; Mrs. Jones smiled and chatted, and
did the honors of the table with rare good grace, but where
was Jones?</p>

<p>"He'll be poking in just as dinner is over, and the puddings
cold, and company preparing to leave; then he'll catch
a lecturing."</p>

<p>But don't fret your pretty self, Mrs. Jones&mdash;for dinner
passed and tea-time came, but no Jones. Mrs. Jones began
to get snappish, and by ten o'clock she had bitten all the
ends from her taper fingers, besides dreadfully scolding the
servants, all around. Mrs. J. finally retired&mdash;the clock had
struck 12, and no Jones was to be seen; Mrs. J. was worried
out; she could not sleep a blessed wink. She got up
again, Jones might have met with some dreadful accident!
She had not thought of that before! Perhaps at that very
hour he was in the bottom of the Hudson, or in the deep
cells of the Tombs! It was awful! Mrs. Jones dressed&mdash;the
house was as still as a church-yard&mdash;she put on an old
hood, and shawl to match, and noiselessly she crept down
stairs; and by a passage out through the back area into a rear
street. Mrs. Jones at the dead hour of night determined to
seek some information of her husband. She had not gotten
over a block, or block and a half from her mansion, when
she spies two men coming along&mdash;wing and wing, merry as
grigs, reeling to and fro, and singing in stentorian notes:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A man that is (hic) married (hic) has lost every hope&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's (hic) like a poor (hic) pig with his foot in a rope!<br /></span>
<span class="i10"><i>O-o-o! dear! O-o-o! dear&mdash;cracky!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man that is (hic) married has so (hic) many ills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's like a (hic) poor fish with a (hic) hook in his gills!<br /></span>
<span class="i10"><i>O-o-o-o! dear! O-o-o-o! dear&mdash;cracky!"</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In terror of these roaring bacchanalians, who were slowly
approaching her, Mrs. Jones stood close in the doorway
of a store; the revellers parted at the corner of the street,
after many asseverations of eternal friendship, much noise
and twattle. One of the carousers came lumbering towards
Mrs. J., and she, in some alarm, left her hiding place and
darted <ins title="pass">past</ins> the midnight brawler; and to her horror, the
fellow made tracks after her as fast as a drunken man could
travel, and that ain't slow; for almost any man inside of
sixty can run, like blazes, when he is scarce able to stand
upon his pins because of the quantity of bricks in his beaver.
Mrs. Jones ran towards her dwelling, but before she
could reach it, the ruffian at her heels clasped her! Just
as she was about to give an awful scream, wake up all the
neighbors and police ten miles around, she saw&mdash;<i>Jones!</i>
Jeff. Jones, her recreant husband!</p>

<p>It was a moment of awful import&mdash;the widow was equal
to the crisis, however, and governed herself accordingly;
proving the truth of some dead and gone philosopher who
has left it in black and white, that the widows are always
more than a <i>match</i> for any man in Christendom!</p>

<p>Jones was loving drunk, a stage that terminates and is a
near kin to total oblivion, in bacchanalian revels. Jones
had not the remotest idea of where he was&mdash;time or persons;
his tongue was thick, eyes dull, ideas monstrous
foggy, and the few sentences he rather unintelligibly uttered,
were highly spiced with&mdash;"my little (hic) angel, you (hic), you
(hic) live 'bout (hic) here? Can't you ta-take me (hic) home
with you, eh? My-my old woman (hic) would raise-rai-raise
old scratch if I (hic), I went home to-to-night. (Hic)
I'll, I'll go home (hic) in the morning, and (hic) tell her,
ha! ha! he! (hic) tell her I've be-be-been to a fire!"</p>

<p>"O, the villain," said Mrs. J. to herself; "but I'll be
revenged. Come, sir, go home with me&mdash;I'll take care of
you. Come, sir, be careful; this way&mdash;in here."</p>

<p>"Where the (hic) deuce are&mdash;are you going down this
(hic) cellar, eh?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir. Come, be careful! don't fall; rest on
my arm&mdash;there, shut the door."</p>

<p>"Why (hic), ha-hang it a&mdash;all; get a light&mdash;that's a de&mdash;ar!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; wait a moment, I'll bring you a light."</p>

<p>Mrs. J. having gotten her game bagged, left it in the
dark, and retired to her bed-chamber. Some of the servants,
hearing a noise in the basement, got up, stuck their
noses out of their rooms, and being convinced that a desperate
scoundrel was in the house, raised the very old boy.
Poor Jones, in his efforts to get out, run over pots, pans,
and chairs, and through him and the servants, the police
were alarmed! lights were raised, and Jones was arrested
for a burglar!</p>

<p>Never was a man better pleased to find himself in his
own domicil, than Jones! It was all Greek to the watchmen
and servants; it was a mysterious matter to Jones for
a full fortnight&mdash;but upon promise of ever after spending
his new year's at home, Mrs. J. let the cat out of the bag.
Jones surrendered!</p>

<h2><a name="Season_at_Saratoga" id="Season_at_Saratoga"></a>Major Blink's First Season at Saratoga.</h2>


<p>"Ha, ha!" said Uncle Joe Blinks, as the subject of
summer travel, a jaunt somewhere, was being discussed
among the regular boarders in Mrs. Bamberry's
spacious old-fashioned parlors; "Ha! ha! ha! ladies, did
Mrs. Bamberry ever tell you of <i>my</i> tour to Saratogy
Springs?&mdash;last summer was two years."</p>

<p>"No," said several of us <i>neuter genders</i> who had repeatedly
heard all about it, but were desirous that those
who had not been thus gratified, especially the ladies, and
particularly a Miss Scarlatina, who was <i>dieting</i> for a tour
to the famed Springs&mdash;"tell us all about it, Major."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Major, with his favorite exclamation,
"then, by the banks of Brandywine, if I don't tell you.
You see, last summer was two years, I came to the conclusion,
that I'd stop off business, altogether, brush up a
little, and go forth a mite more in the world, and I went.
A friend of mine, a married man, was going up north to
Saratogy, with his wife and sister&mdash;a plaguy nice young
woman, the sister was, too; well, I don't know how it was,
exactly, but somehow or other, it came into my head, especially
as my friend Padlock had asked me if I wouldn't like
to go up to Saratogy&mdash;that I'd go, and I went. It was
odd enough, to be sure," said Uncle Joe, taking a pinch of
rappee from his tortoise-shell box&mdash;"very odd, in fact,
but somehow or other, Mrs. Padlock, being in poor health,
and her sister, a rather volatile and inexperienced young
woman, you may say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that you had to <i>beau</i> her along the way, Uncle
Joe?" says several of the company.</p>

<p>"Well, yes; it was very odd, I don't know how it was,
but somehow or other, I-a&mdash;I-a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out with it, Uncle Joe&mdash;own up; you cottoned to the
young lady, gallant as possible, eh?" says the gents.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! it's a very delicate thing, very delicate, I
assure you, gentlemen, for an old bachelor to be on the
slightest terms of intimacy with a young&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And beautiful!" echoed the company.</p>

<p>"Unexperienced," continued the Major.</p>

<p>"And unprotected," says the chorus.</p>

<p>"Volatile," added the Major.</p>

<p>"And marriageable young lady, like Miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Catchem," said the Major.</p>

<p>"Catchem!" cried the gents.</p>

<p>"Catchem, that was her name; she was the daughter of
a very respectable widow," continued the Major.</p>

<p>"A widow's daughter, eh?" said they all, now much interested
in Uncle Joe's journey to Saratoga, and&mdash;but we
won't anticipate.</p>

<p>"Of a very respectable widow, whose husband, I believe,
was a&mdash;but no matter, they were of good family, and a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Uncle Joe," said the ladies, "no doubt of that;
go on with your story; you paid attention to Miss
Catchem; you grew familiar&mdash;you became mutually pleased
with each other, and you finally&mdash;well, tell us how it all
came out, Uncle Joe, do!" they cried.</p>

<p>"Bless me, ladies! You've quite got ahead of my story&mdash;altogether!
Miss Catchem and I never spoke a word
to each other in our lives," said the Major.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Joe!" cried the whole party.</p>

<p>"By banks of Brandywine, it's a fact."</p>

<p>"Well, we never!" cried all the ladies.</p>

<p>"Well, ladies, I don't suppose you ever did," Uncle Joe
responds. "The fact is, Mrs. Padlock died suddenly the
week Padlock spoke to me of going to Saratogy, and
he married her sister, Miss Catchem, in course of a few
weeks after, himself! I don't know how it was, but somehow
or other, I thought it was all for the best; things
might have turned out that I should have got tangled up
with that girl, and a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Been a married man, now, instead of a bachelor,
Uncle Joe!" said the young ladies.</p>

<p>"It's odd; I don't know how it was, ladies; it might
have been so, but it turned out just as I have stated."</p>

<p>"Well, well, Major," said an elderly person of the group;
"go on; how about Saratoga?"</p>

<p>"I will," says Uncle Joe, again resorting to his rappee,
"I will. You see Padlock didn't <i>go</i>, it was very odd; but
somehow or other, I made up my mind to <i>go</i>, and I went.
I calculated to be gone three or four weeks, and I concluded
for once, at least, to loosen the strings of my purse,
if I never did again; so I laid out to expend three
dollars or so, each day, say eighty dollars for the trip; a
good round sum, I assure you, to fritter away; but, by
banks of Brandywine, I was determined to <i>do</i> it, and I did.
It was very odd, but the first person I met at New York
was an old friend, a schoolmate of mine. I was glad to
see him, and sorry enough to learn that he had failed in
business&mdash;had a large family&mdash;poor&mdash;in distress. It was
very odd, but somehow or other, we dined at the hotel
together&mdash;had a bottle of Madeira, and I a&mdash;well, I loaned&mdash;yes,
by banks of Brandywine, I gave the poor fellow
a twenty dollar bill, shook hands and parted; yes, poor Billy
Merrifellow, we never met again; he&mdash;he died soon after,
in distress, his family broke up&mdash;scattered; it was very odd;
poor fellow, he's gone;" and Uncle Joe again had recourse
to his rappee, while a large tear hung in the corner of his
full blue eye. Closing his box, and wiping his face with
his <i>pongee</i>, the Major continued:</p>

<p>"Next morning I called for my bill. I was astonished
to find that a couple of bottles of good wine, two extra
meals, and something over one day's board, figured up the
round sum of ten dollars. I was three days out, so far,
and my pocket-book was lessened of half the funds intended
for a month's expenses! By banks of Brandywine,
thinks Major, my boy, this won't do; you must economize,
or you shall be short of your reckonings before you
are a week out of port. That morning at the steam-boat
wharf I meets a young man very genteelly dressed; he
looked in deep distress about something. It was very odd,
I don't know how it was, but somehow or other, he came
up to me and asked if I was going up the river, and I very
civilly told him I was; then, he up and tells me he was a
stranger in the city, had lost all his money by gambling,
was in great distress&mdash;had nothing but a valuable watch&mdash;a
present from his deceased father, a Virginia planter, and a
great deal more. He begged me to buy the watch, when
I refused at first, but finally he so importuned me, and
offered the watch at a rate so apparently below its real value
that I up and gave him forty dollars for it, thinking I
might in part, indemnify my previous extravagance by this
little bit of a trade. It was very odd; I don't know how
it was, but somehow or other, upon my arrival at Saratogy,
I found that watch wasn't worth the powder that
would blow it up! I was imposed upon, cheated by a
scoundrel! Here I was, four days from home, and my
whole month's outfit nigh about gone. In the stage that
took us from the boat to the Springs, rode a very respectable
youngish-looking woman, with a very cross child in
her arms; we had not rode far before I found the other
passengers, all gentlemen, apparently much annoyed by the
child; for my part I sympathized with the poor woman,
got into a conversation with her&mdash;learned she was on her
way to Saratogy to see her husband, who was engaged
there as a builder. Upon arriving at Saratogy, the young
woman requested me to hold her child&mdash;it was fast asleep&mdash;until
she stepped over to a new building to inquire about
her husband. I did so; she went away, and I never saw
her from that to this!"</p>

<p>A loud and prolonged laugh from his auditors followed
this <i>tableau</i> in Uncle Joe's story. A little more rappee,
and the Major proceeded:</p>

<p>"Well, it was very odd, I don't know how it was, but
somehow or other I was left with the child, and a plaguy
time had I of it; the town authorities refused to take charge
of it, nobody else would; so by Brandywine, there I was;
the people seemed to be suspicious of me&mdash;sniggered and
went on as though I knew more about the woman and her
child than I let on. In short, I had to father the child,
and provide for it, and I did," said the Major, quite patriotically.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, Uncle Joe," said Mrs. Bamberry;
"that boy may pay you yet&mdash;pay you for all your trouble;
he's growing nicely, and will make a fine man."</p>

<p>"So you really had to keep the child!" cried several.</p>

<p>"O yes," says the Major; "I was in for it; I got a nurse
and had the youngster taken care of. The hotels were
crowded, very uncomfortable, rooms wretched, small, damp,
and dirty. The landlords were quite independent, and the
servants the most impudent set of extorting varlets I ever
encountered! To keep from starving, I did as others&mdash;bribed
a waiter to keep my plate supplied. At night they
had what they called 'hops!' in other words, dances, shaking
the whole house, and raising such a noise and hullabaloo,
with cracked horns, squeaky fiddles&mdash;bawling and
yelling, that no sailor boarding house could be half so disturbant
of the peace. By banks of Brandywine, I got
enough of such <i>folderols</i>; at the end of the week I asked
for my bill, augmented by some few sundries&mdash;it made my
hair stand up. Now what do you suppose my bill was, for
one week, board, lodging, servants' <i>bribes</i> and sundries?
I'll tell you," said the Major, "for you never could guess
it&mdash;it was forty-one dollars, fifty cents. I took my <i>protege</i>,
bag and baggage, and started for home. I was absent on
this memorable tour to Saratogy just two weeks, and by
banks of Brandywine, if the expense of that tour&mdash;not including
the time <i>wasted</i>, vexation, bother, mortification of
feelings, fuss, and rumpus&mdash;was but a fraction less than
three hundred dollars! Four times the cost of my anticipated
trip, lessened half the time, with fifty per cent. more
humbug about it than I ever dreamed of!"</p>

<p>Miss Scarlatina agreed with the rest of the company,
that it cost Uncle Joe Blinks more to go to Saratogy than
it came to, and they all concluded&mdash;not to go there themselves,
just then&mdash;any how!</p>

<h2><a name="Killed_Capt_Walker" id="Killed_Capt_Walker"></a>Who Killed Capt. Walker?</h2>


<p>Few incidents of the campaign in Mexico seem so
mixed up and indefinite as that relative to the taking
of Huamantla, and the death of that noble and chivalric
officer, Capt. Walker. In glancing over the papers of
Major Mammond, of Georgia, which he designates the
"Secondary Combats of the Mexican War," we observe
that he has given an account of the engagement at Huamantla,
and the fall of Walker. We believe the Major's
account, compiled as it is from "the documents," to be in
the main correct, but lacking incidental pith, and slightly
erroneous in the grand <i>denouement</i>, in which our gallant
friend&mdash;whose manly countenance even now stares us in the
face, as if in life he "yet lived"&mdash;yielded up the balance
of power on earth.</p>

<p>We have taken some pains, and a great deal of interest
surely, in coming at the facts; and no time seems so proper
as the present&mdash;several of the chivalric gentlemen of that
day and occasion, being now around us&mdash;to give the story
its veritable exhibition of true interest.</p>

<p>Capt. S. H. Walker was a Marylander, a young man of
the truest possible heroism and gallantry. He entered upon
the campaign with all the ardor and enterprise of a soldier
devoted to the best interests of his country. He commanded
a company of mounted men, whose bravery was
only equalled by his own, and whose discipline and hardiness
has been unsurpassed, if equalled, by any troops of
the world. We shall skip over the thousand and one incidents
of the line of action in which Walker, Lewis, and
their brave companions in arms did gallant service, to come
at the sanguinary and truly thrilling <i>denouement</i>.</p>

<p>Gen. Lane, after the landing and organization of his
troops at Vera Cruz, with some 2500 men, started for Puebla,
where it was understood that Col. Childs required
reinforcement. Lane left Jalapa on the 1st of October,
and hurried forward with Lally's command. At Perote,
Lane learned that Santa Anna would throw himself upon his
muscle, and give the advancing columns jessy at the pass
of Pinal, and there was every prospect of a very tight time.
Col. Wynkoop was in command at Perote; the men were
anxious to be "in" at the fight in prospective, and Wynkoop
obtained permission to join the General with four
companies of the Pennsylvania Regiment; a small battery
of the 3d Artillery, under command of Capt. Taylor, with
Capts. Walker, of the Texan Rangers, and Lewis, of the
Louisiana Cavalry. The column was now swelled to some
2800. They moved rapidly forward, and upon reaching
Tamaris, Lane heard that the old fox was off&mdash;Santa Anna
had gone to Huamantla. Lane determined to hunt him up
with haste. The main force was left at Tamaris. Troops
were forwarded&mdash;advanced by Walker's Rangers and
Lewis's Cavalry&mdash;who approached to within sight, or nearly
so, of Huamantla. The orders to Walker were to advance
to the town, and if the Mexicans were in force, to wait for
the Infantry to come up. Walker's command rated about
200 men. Upon reaching the outskirts of Huamantla, the
Mexican Cavalry were seen dashing forward into the town,
and the brave Walker ordered a pursuit.</p>

<p>Santa Anna was evidently in the town. Capt. Walker,
says his gallant comrade Lewis, made up his mind to be the
captor of the wily old chief. The fair prospect of accomplishing
the deed so excited Walker, that danger and death
were alike secondary considerations, and so the command
charged into the town. Some 500 lancers met the charge,
but with terrific impetuosity the Rangers and Cavalry
dashed in among them, cutting them down right and left,
and soon sent them flying in all directions! It was at this
moment, says Capt. Lewis, that one of the most heroic acts
of bravery was performed, unsurpassed, perhaps, by any act
of personal daring during the whole war! A tremendous
negro, a fine, manly fellow, named Dave, belonging to
Capt. Walker, with whom he was brought up&mdash;boys together&mdash;being
mounted, and armed with a heavy sabre,
dashed forward down a narrow street, (up which, a detached
body of lancers were striving to escape,) and throwing
himself between three poised lances and the person of
Dr. Lamar, one of the surgeons, who would have been
most inevitably torn to atoms, Dave raised himself in his
saddle, and with a yell, and one fell swoop, the heroic fellow
"chopped down" a lancer, clean and clear to his saddle!
Two lancers pierced Dave's body, and he fell from his horse, dead!</p>

<p>Charging up to the Plaza&mdash;the Mexicans flying&mdash;Capt.
Walker dismounted, with some thirty of his men, and advanced
up a flight of steps to force an entrance into a
church or convent, where he supposed Santa Anna was hid
away. The flying lancers were pursued by the Rangers,
who, very injudiciously, of course, scattered themselves over the town.</p>

<p>Capt. Lewis, in the mean time, had found a large yard
attached to a temporary garrison, in which were some sixty
horses, equipped ready for immediate use, and which the
Mexicans had, in their hurry to escape, left behind them!
The irregular firing of the Rangers, in pursuit of the Mexicans,
being deemed useless and unnecessary, Capt. Lewis
left several of his men, among whom was "Country McCluskey,"
the noted pugilist, a volunteer in Capt. Lewis's company,
to guard the horses, while he rode forward to the convent.</p>

<p>"Capt. Walker," said Lewis, "I deem it, sir, not only
useless, but bad policy, to allow that firing by the men,
around the town."</p>

<p>Capt. Walker immediately ordered the firing to cease,
and being apprized of Capt. Lewis's discovery of the
horses, &amp;c., ordered him to bring up his command. Capt.
Lewis wheeled his horse; some one fired close by, and
Capt. Walker cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who was that? I'll shoot down the next man who
fires against my orders!"</p>

<p>At that moment three guns were fired from the convent&mdash;and
simultaneously a cannon was fired down the street,
from a party of Mexicans in the distance. Capt. Lewis
faced about just in time to see Capt. Walker drop down
upon the steps of the convent, as he emphatically expresses it,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Like a lump of lead, sir!"</p>

<p>The piece up the street was fired again. Capt. Lewis
ordered the fallen, gallant Walker, to be placed upon the
steps close to the wall. A shot from the piece alluded to
striking off the stone and mortar, he ordered the doors to
be forced, and Capt. Walker to be taken in, which was
done. The bugle sounded, and in an instant a horde of
lancers poured into the town, rushing down upon the Americans
from every avenue! Capt. Lewis had wheeled about
to collect his men, when he found McCluskey and others
leading out "the pick" of the captured horses.</p>

<p>"Drop&mdash;drop the horses, you fool, and mount! Mount, sir, mount!"</p>

<p>They mounted fast enough; Lewis formed, and met the
enemy in gallant style; and though there were ten, aye,
twenty to one, possibly, he drove them back! To quote
our friend, Major Hammond's words, "Lewis, of the Louisiana
Cavalry, assumed command, struggled ably to preserve
the guns (captured), and held his position fairly,
until assistance arrived."</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty of the enemy fell, while of the
Rangers and Cavalry some twenty-five were killed and
wounded. They were engaged nearly an hour, and the
bravery displayed by Walker, Lewis, and their men, was
worthy of general admiration, and all honor.</p>

<p>Poor Walker! a ball struck him in the left shoulder,
passed over his heart, and came out in his right vest pocket!</p>

<p>Thus fell the gallant leader of one of the most formidable
war parties, of its numbers, known to history. Walker
was a humane, impulsive man; a warm friend, a brave,
gallant soldier. His dying words were directed to Capt.
Lewis&mdash;to keep the town, and drive back the enemy; and
that the chivalrous Captain did so, was well proven. Capt.
Walker, and his heroic "boy" Dave, who fell unknown to
his master, were buried together in the earth they so lately
stood upon, in all the glory and heroism of men that were men!</p>

<p>Shakspeare has written&mdash;"let him that's robbed&mdash;not
wanting what is stolen, not know it, <i>and he's not
robbed at all!</i>" Now this fact often becomes very apparent,
especially so in the case of Mrs. Pompaliner,&mdash;a lady
of whom we have had occasion to speak before, the same
who sent Mrs. Brown, the washerwomen, sundry boxes of
perfume to mix in her <i>suds</i>, while washing the pyramids
of dimity and things of Mrs. P. There never was a lady&mdash;no
member of the sex, that ever suffered more, from
dread of contagion, fear of dirt, and the contamination of
other people, than Mrs. Pompaliner.</p>

<p>"Olivia," said she, one morning, to one of her waiting
maids, for Mrs. Pompaliner kept three, alternating them
upon the principle of varying her handkerchiefs, gloves and
linen, as they&mdash;in her double-distilled refined idea of things,
became soiled by use, from time to time. "Olivia, come
here&mdash;Jessamine, you can leave:" she was so intent upon
odor and nature's purest loveliness, that she either sought
sweet-scented cognomened waiting-maids, or nick-named
them up to the fanciful standard of her own.</p>

<p>"Olivia, here, take this handkerchief away, take the horrid
thing away. I believe my soul somebody has touched
it after it was ironed. Do take it away," and the poor
victim of concentrated, double extract of human extravagance,
almost fainted and fell back upon her lounge, in a
fit of abhorrence at the idea of her <i>mouchoir</i> being touched,
tossed, or opened, after it entered her camphorated drawers
in her highly-perfumed <i>boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>"Olivia!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," was the response of the fine, ruddy, and wholesome
looking maid.</p>

<p>"Olivia, put on your gloves."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Go down to Mrs. Brown's," she faintly says&mdash;"tell her
to come here this very day."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Olivia!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," replied the fine-eyed, real woman.</p>

<p>"Got your gloves on?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Well, take this key, go to my boudoir, in the fifth
drawer of my <i>papier mache</i> black bureau, you will find a
case of handkerchiefs."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Take out three, yes, four, close the case, lock the
drawer, close the boudoir door, and bring down the handkerchiefs
upon my rosewood tray. Do you comprehend, Olivia?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said the girl.</p>

<p>"But come here; let me see your hands. O, horror!
such gloves! touch my handkerchiefs or bureau drawers
with those horrid gloves! Poison me!" cries the terrified woman.</p>

<p>"Olivia," she again ejaculates, after a moment's pause,
from overtasked nature!</p>

<p>"Yes'm," the blushing, tickled <i>blonde</i> replies.</p>

<p>"Go call Vanilla, you are quite soiled now. I want a
fresh servant, retire."</p>

<p>"Ah, Vanilla, girl, have you got your gloves on?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," the yellow girl modestly answers.</p>

<p>"Then do go and bring me six handkerchiefs from my
boudoir, in the fifth drawer of my black <i>papier mache</i>
bureau. Let me see your gloves, dear.</p>

<p>"Ah, Vanilla, you are to be depended upon; your
gloves are clean&mdash;now run along, dear, for I'm suffering for
a fresh, new, and untouched handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's well. Now, Vanilla, go to Mrs. Brown's,
my laundress&mdash;say that I wish her to come here, immediately."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," says the bright quadroon, and away she spins
for the domicil of democratic Mrs. Brown, the laundress.</p>

<p>"Now what's up, I'd like to know?" quoth the old woman.</p>

<p>"Dunno, missus wants to see you&mdash;guess you better
come," says Vanilla.</p>

<p>"Deuce take sich fussy people," says Mrs. Brown; "I
wouldn't railly put up with all her dern'd nonsense, ef she
wa'n't so poorly, so weak in her mind and body, and so good
about paying for her work. No, I declare I wouldn't," said
the strong-minded woman.</p>

<p>"Bring the creature up," said Mrs. Pompaliner, as one
of her fresh attendants announced the washerwoman.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the fat, hardy, and independent, if awkward,
Mrs. Brown, as she stood in the august presence of Mrs.
Pompaliner, and the gorgeous trappings of her own private
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I am, ma'am!" says the she-democrat.</p>

<p>"Vanilla, tell Olivia to bring Jessamine here."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Now Mrs. a&mdash;what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Brown, Dorcas Brown; my husband and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, that's sufficient, Mrs. a&mdash;Brown," said
the reclining Mrs. Pompaliner. "I wish to know if anybody
is permitted to touch or handle any of my wardrobe,
my linen, handkerchiefs, hose, gloves, laces, etc., in your house?"</p>

<p>"Tetch 'em!" echoes the rotund laundress; "why of
course we've got to tetch 'em, or how'd we get 'em ironed
and put in your baskets, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Do you pretend to say, Mrs. a&mdash;Brown&mdash;O dear! dear!
I am afraid you have ruined all my clothes!"</p>

<p>"Ruined 'em?" quoth Mrs. Brown, coloring up, like a
fresh and lively lobster immersed in a pot of highly caloric water.</p>

<p>"I want to know if the things ain't been done this week
as well as I ever did 'em, could do 'em, or anybody could
do 'em on this mighty yeath (earth), ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, don't get me flustered, woman," cries the
poor, faint Mrs. Pompaliner. "Don't come here to worry
me; answer me and go."</p>

<p>"So I can go, ma'am!" said Mrs. Brown, with a vigorous
toss of her bullet head.</p>

<p>"Stop, will you understand me, Mrs.&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Brown, ma'am, Brown's my name. I ain't afeard to let
anybody know it!" responded the spunky laundress.</p>

<p>The arrival of Olivia, who ushered in Jessamine, turned
the current of affairs.</p>

<p>"Jessamine, your gloves on, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Then go to my <i>boudoir</i>, open the rose-wood clothes
case, bring down the skirts, a dozen or two of the <i>mouchoirs</i>,
the laces and hose."</p>

<p>The girl departed, and soon returned with a ponderous
paper box, laden with the articles required.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mrs. Pompaliner, "now, Brown, look at
those articles; don't you see that they have been touched?"</p>

<p>"Tetched! lord-a-massy, ma'am, how'd you get 'em ironed,
folded and brought home, ma'am, without tetching 'em?"</p>

<p>"Olivia, Vanilla, where are you? Jessamine, dear, bring
me a fresh handkerchief, ignite a <i>pastile</i>, there's such an
odor in the room. Do you <i>smell</i>, Mrs. a&mdash;Brown, that
horrid lavender or rose, or, or,&mdash;do you smell it, Brown?"</p>

<p>"Lord-a-massy, ma'am," said the old woman of suds, "I
ollers smell a dreadful smell here; them parfumeries o'
yourn, I often tell my Augusty, I wonder them stinkin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O! O! dear!" cries Mrs. Pompaliner, going off "into
a spell;" recovering a little, Mrs. Pompaliner proceeds to
state that for some time past, she had been troubled with <i>a
presentiment</i>, that her fine clothes had been tampered with
after leaving the smoothing iron, and how fatal to her
would be the fact of any mortal daring to use, in the remotest
manner, any fresh garment or personal apparel of
hers! Suspicion had been aroused, the articles before the
parties were now diligently examined, when, lo! a spot, not
unlike a slight smear of vermilion, was discovered upon a
splendid handkerchief&mdash;it gave Mrs. P. an electric shock;
but, O horror! the next thing turned up was a <i>spangle</i>, big
as a half dime, upon one of Mrs. P.'s most superb skirts!
This awful revelation, connected with the smell of vile
lavender and worse patchouly, upon another piece of woman
gear, threw Mrs. Pompaliner into spasms, between the
motions of which she gasped:</p>

<p>"You have a daughter, Mrs. Brown?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"About seventeen, ma'am."</p>

<p>"And she a&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Dances in the theatre, ma'am!"</p>

<p>The whole thing was out: the sacred garments of Mrs. P.
had not only been <i>touched</i> by sacrilegious hands, but had
had an airing, and smelt the lamps of the play-house! Mrs.
Pompaliner was so shocked, that four first-class physicians
tended her for a whole season.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown lost a profitable customer, and well walloped
her ballet-nymph daughter Augusty, for attiring herself in
the finery of her most possibly particular and sensitive
customer! It was awful!</p>

<h2><a name="Legal_Advice" id="Legal_Advice"></a>Legal Advice.</h2>


<p>Old Ben. Franklin said it was his opinion that,
between imprisonment and being at large in debt to
your neighbor, there was no <i>difference</i> worthy the name of
it. Some people have a monstrous sight of courage in
debt, more than they have out of it, while we have known
some, who, though not afraid to stand fire or water, shook
in their very boots&mdash;wilted right down, before the frown of
a creditor! A man that can <i>dun</i> to death, or stand a
deadly <i>dun</i>, possesses talents no Christian need envy; for,
next to Lucifer, we look upon the confirmed "diddler"
and professional <i>dun</i>, for every ignoble trait in the character
of mankind. A friend at our elbow has just possessed
us of some facts so mirth-provoking, (to us, not to him,)
that we jot them down for the amusement and information
of suffering mankind and the rest of creation, who now
and then get into a scrimmage with rogues, lawyers and
law. And perhaps it may be as well to let the <i>indefatigable</i>
tell his own story:</p>

<p>"You see, Cutaway dealt with me, and though he knew
I was dead set against <i>crediting</i> anybody, he would insist,
and did&mdash;get into my books. I let it run along until the
amount reached sixty dollars, and Cutaway, instead of
stopping off and paying me up, went in deeper! Getting
in debt seemed to make him desperate, reckless! One day
he came in when I was out; he and his wife look around,
and, by George! they select a handsome tea-set, worth
twenty dollars, and my fool clerk sends it home.</p>

<p>"'Tell him to <i>charge it!</i>' says Cutaway, to the boy who
took the china home; and I did charge it.</p>

<p>"The upshot of the business was, I found out that Cutaway
was a confirmed <i>diddler</i>; he got all he wanted, when
and where he could, upon the 'charge it' principle, and
had become so callous to duns, that his moral compunctions
were as tough as sole leather&mdash;bullet-proof.</p>

<p>"I was vexed, I was <i>mad</i>, I determined to break one of
my 'fixed principles,' and <i>go to law</i>; have my money,
goods, or a row! I goes to a lawyer, states my case, gave
him a fee and told him to go to work.</p>

<p>"Cutaway, of course, received a polite invitation to step
up to Van Nickem's office and learn something to his advantage;
and he attended. A few days afterwards I dropped in.</p>

<p>"'Your man's been here,' says Van Nickem, smilingly.</p>

<p>"'Has, eh? Well, what's he done?' said I.</p>

<p>"'O, he acknowledges the <i>debt</i>, says he thinks you are
rather hurrying up the biscuits, and thinks you might have
sent the bill to him instead of giving it to me for collection,'
says the lawyer.</p>

<p>"'Send it to him!' says I. 'Why I sent it fifty times;&mdash;sent
my clerk until he got ashamed of going, and my boy
went so often that his boots got into such a way of <i>going</i>
to Cutaway's shop, that he had to change them with his
brother, <i>when he was going anywhere else!</i>'</p>

<p>"'He appears to be a clever sort of a fellow,' said Van.</p>

<p>"'He <i>is</i>,' said I, 'the cleverest, most perfectly-at-home
<i>diddler</i> in town.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' said Van Nickem, 'Cutaway acknowledges the
debt, says he's rather straightened just now, but if you'll
give him a little more <i>time</i>, he'll fork up every cent; so if
I were you, I'd wait a little and see.'</p>

<p>"Well, I did wait. I didn't want to appear more eager
for law than a lawyer, so I waited&mdash;three months. At the
end of that time, early one Saturday morning, in came Cutaway.
'Aha!' says I, 'you are going to <i>fork</i> now, at
last; it's well you come, for I'd been <i>down</i> on you on Monday,
bright and early!'"</p>

<p>"You didn't say that to him, did you?" we observed.</p>

<p>"O, bless you, <i>no</i>. I said <i>that</i> to <i>myself</i>, but I met <i>him</i>
with a smile, and with a 'how d'ye do, Cutaway?' and in
my excitement at the prospect of receiving the $80, which
I then wanted the worst kind, I shook hands with him,
asked how his family was, and got as familiar and jocular
with him as though he was the most cherished friend I had
in the world! Well, now what do you suppose was the
result of that interview with Cutaway?"</p>

<p>"Paid you a portion, or all of your bill against him, we
suppose," was our response.</p>

<p>"Not by a long shot; with the coolness of a pirate he
asked me to credit him for a handsome wine-tray, a dozen
cut goblets and glasses, and a pair of decanters; he expected
some friends from New York that evening, was
going to give them a 'set out' at his house, and one of the
guests, in consideration of former favors rendered by him,
was pledged&mdash;being a man of wealth&mdash;to loan him enough
funds to pay his debts, and take up a mortgage on his residence."</p>

<p>"You laughed at his impudence, and kicked him out into
the street?" said we.</p>

<p>"I hope I may be hung if I didn't let him have the
goods, and he took them home with him, swearing by all
that was good and bad, he would settle with me early the
following Monday morning. I saw no more of <i>him</i> for
two weeks! I went to Van Nickem's, he laughed at me.
The bill was now $100. I was raging. I told Van Nickem
I'd have my money out of Cutaway, or I'd advertise
him for a villain, swindler, and scoundrel."</p>

<p>"'He'd sue you for libel, and obtain damages,' said Van.</p>

<p>"'Then I'll horsewhip him, sir, within an inch of his
life, in the open street!' said I, in a heat.</p>

<p>"'You might <i>rue</i> that,' said Van. 'He'd sue you for
an assault, and give you trouble and expense.'</p>

<p>"'Then I suppose I can do nothing, eh?&mdash;the <i>law</i> being
<i>made</i> for the benefit of such villains!'</p>

<p>"'We will arrest him,' said Van.</p>

<p>"'Well, then what?' said I.</p>

<p>"'We will haul him up to the bull ring, we will have
the money, attach his property, goods or chattels, or clap
him in jail, sir!' said Van Nickem, with an air of determination.</p>

<p>"I felt relieved; the hope of putting the rascal in jail,
I confess, was dearer to me than the $100. I told Van to
go it, give the rascal jessy, and Van did; but after three
weeks' vexatious litigation, Cutaway went to jail, swore
out, and, to my mortification, I learned that he had
been through that sort of process so often that, like the
old woman's skinned eels, he was used to it, and rather
liked the sensation than otherwise! Well, saddled with
the costs, foiled, gouged, swindled, and laughed at, you
may fancy my feelinks, as Yellow Plush remarks."</p>

<p>"So you lost the $100&mdash;got whipped, eh?" we remarked.</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir</i>," said our litigious friend. "I cornered him, I
got old Cutaway in a tight place at last, and that's the pith
of the transaction. Cutaway, having swindled and shaved
about half the community with whom he <i>had</i> any transactions,&mdash;got
his affairs all fixed smooth and quiet, and with
his family was off for California. I got wind of it,&mdash;Van
Nickem and I had a conference.</p>

<p>"'We'll have him,' says Van. 'Find out what time he
sails, where the vessel is, &amp;c.; lay back until a few hours
before the vessel is to cut loose, then go down, get the fellow
ashore if you can, talk to him, soft soap him, ask him
if he won't pay if he has luck in California, &amp;c., and so on,
and when you've got him a hundred yards from the vessel,
knock him down, pummel him well; I'll have an officer
ready to arrest both of you for breach of the peace; when
you are brought up, I'll have a <i>charge</i> made out against
Cutaway for something or other, and if he don't fork out
and clear, I'm mistaken,' said Van. I followed his advice
to the letter; I pummelled Cutaway well; we were taken
up and fined, and Cutaway was in a great hurry to say but
little and get off. But Van and the <i>writ</i> appeared. Cutaway
looked streaked&mdash;he was alarmed. In two hours' time
he disgorged not only my bill, but a bill of forty dollars
costs! He then cut for the ship, the meanest looking white
man you ever saw!"</p>

<p>If Mr. Cutaway don't take the <i>force</i> of that moral, <i>salt</i>
won't save him.</p>

not allowing their clerks and book-keepers to dot their

<p>We shall never forget, and always feel proud of the
fact, that we <i>knew</i> so great an every-day <i>Plato</i> as
Davy Crockett. Had the old Colonel never uttered a better
idea than that everlasting good motto&mdash;"Be sure you're
right, then go ahead!" his wisdom would stand a pretty
good wrestle with tide and time, before his standing, as a
man of genius, would pass to oblivion&mdash;be washed out in
Lethe's waters. We remember hearing Col. Crockett relate,
during a "speech," a short time before he lost his life
at the <i>Alamo</i>, in Texas&mdash;a little incident, of his being taken
up in New Orleans, one night, by a <i>gen d'arme</i>&mdash;lugged to
the calaboose, and kept there as an out-and-out "hard
case," not being able to find any body, hardly, that knew
him, and being totally unable to reconcile the chief of police
to the fact that he <i>was</i> the identical Davy Crockett, or
any body else, above par! "If you want to find out your
'level,'&mdash;<i>ad valorem</i>, wake up some morning, noon or night&mdash;<i>where
nobody knows you!</i>" said the Colonel, "and if
you ever feel so essentially chawed up, <i>raw</i>, as I did in the
calaboose, the Lord pity you!"</p>

<p>There was a "modern instance" of Colonel Crockett's
"wise saw," in the case of a certain Philadelphia millionaire,
who was in the habit of <i>carting</i> himself out, in a very
ancient and excessively shabby gig; which, in consequence
of its utter ignorance of the stable-boy's brush, sponge or
broom, and the hospitalities the old concern nightly offered
the hens&mdash;was not exactly the kind of <i>equipage</i> calculated
to win attention or marked respect, for the owner and driver.
The old millionaire, one day in early October, took
it into his head to ride out and see the country. Taking
an early start, the old gentleman, and his old bob-tailed,
frost-bitten-looking horse, with that same old shabby gig,
about dusk, found themselves under the swinging sign of a
Pennsylvania Dutch tavern, in the neighborhood of Reading.
As nobody bestirred themselves to see to the traveller,
he put his very old-fashioned face and wig outside of
the vehicle, and called&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hel-lo! hos-e-lair? Landlord?"</p>

<p>Leisurely stalking down the steps, the Dutch hostler advanced
towards the queer and questionable travelling equipage.</p>

<p>"Vel, vot you vont, ah?"</p>

<p>"Vat sal I vant? I sal vant to put oup my hoss, vis-ze
stab'l, viz two pecks of oats and plenty of hay, hos-e-lair."</p>

<p>"Yaw," was the laconic grunt of the hostler, as he proceeded
to unhitch old bald-face from his rigging.</p>

<p>"Stop one little," said the traveller. "I see 'tis very
mosh like to rain, to-night; put up my gig in ze stab'l, too."</p>

<p>"Boosh, tonner and blitzen, der rain not hurt yer ole gig!"</p>

<p>"I pay you for vat you sal do for me, mind vat I sal
say, sair, if you pleaze."</p>

<p>The hostler, very surlily, led the traveller's weary old
brute to the stable; but, prior to carrying out the orders
of the traveller, he sought the landlord, to know if it would
<i>pay</i> to put up the shabby concern, and treat the old horse
to a real feed of hay and oats, without making some inquiries
into the financial situation of the old Frenchman.</p>

<p>The landlord, with a country lawyer and a neighboring
farmer, were at the <i>Bar</i>, one of those old-fashioned <i>slatted</i>
coops, in a corner, peculiar to Pennsylvania, discussing the
merits of a law suit, seizure of the property, &amp;c., of a deceased
tiller of the soil, in the vicinity. Busily chatting,
and quaffing their <i>toddy</i>, the entrance of the poor old
traveller was scarcely noticed, until he had divested himself
of his old, many-caped cloak, and demurely taken a seat in
the room. The hostler having reappeared, and talked a
little Dutch to the host, that worthy turned to the traveller&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good even'ns, thravel'r!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sair;" pleasantly responded the Frenchman, "a little."</p>

<p>"You got a hoss, eh?" continued the landlord.</p>

<p>"Yes, sair, I vish ze hostlair to give mine hoss plenty to
eat&mdash;plenty hay, plenty oats, plenty watair, sair."</p>

<p>"Yaw," responded the landlord, "den, Jacob, give'm der
oats, and der hay, and der water;" and, with this brief
direction to his subordinate, the landlord turned away from
the way-worn traveller to resume his conversation with his
more, apparently, influential friends. The old Frenchman
very patiently waited until the discussion should cease, and
the landlord's ear be disengaged, that he might be apprized
of the fact that travellers had stomachs, and that of the
old French gentleman was highly <i>incensed</i> by long delay,
and more particularly by the odorous fumes of roast fowls,
ham and eggs, &amp;c., issuing from the inner portion of the tavern.</p>

<p>"Landlord, I vil take suppair, if you please," said he.</p>

<p>"Yaw; after dese gentlemans shall eat der suppers, den
somesing will be prepared for you."</p>

<p>"Sair!" said the old Frenchman, firing up; "I vill not
vait for ze shentilmen; I vant my suppair now, directly&mdash;right
away; I not vait for nobody, sair!"</p>

<p>"If you no like 'em, den you go off, out mine house,"
answered the old sour krout, "you old barber!"</p>

<p>"Bar-bair!" gasped the old Frenchman, in suppressed
rage. "Sair, I vill go no where, I vill stay here so long,
by gar, as&mdash;as&mdash;as I please, sair!"</p>

<p>"Are you aware, sir," interposed the legal gentleman,
"that you are rendering gross and offensive, malicious and
libellous, scandalous and burglarious language to this gentleman,
in his own domicile, with malice prepense and aforethought, and a &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! <i>pooh!</i> for you, sair!" testily replied the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Pooh? To me, sir? <i>Me, sir?</i>" bullyingly echoed Blackstone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sair&mdash;pooh&mdash;<i>pooh!</i> von geese, sair!"</p>

<p>It were vain to try to depict the rage of wounded pride,
the insolence of a travelling <i>barber</i> had stirred up in the
very face of the man of law, logic, and legal lore. He
swelled up, blowed and strutted about like a <i>miffed</i> gobbler
in a barn yard! He tried to cork down his rage, but it
bursted forth&mdash;</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;you infernal old frog-eating, soap and
lather, you&mdash;you&mdash;you smoke-dried, one-eyed,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> poor old
wretch, you, if it wasn't for pity's sake, I'd have you taken
up and put in the county jail, for vagrancy, I would, you
poverty-stricken old rascal!"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Girard, it will be remembered, had but one eye. With that, however,
he saw as much as many do with a full pair of eyes.</p></div>

<p>"Jacob!" bawled the landlord, to his sub., "bring out
der ole hoss again, pefore he die mit de crows, in mine stable;
now, you ole fool, you shall go vay pout your bishenish
mit nossin to eat, mit yer hoss too!" said the landlord, with
an evident rush of blood and beer to his head!</p>

<p>"Oh, veri well," patiently answered the old Frenchman,
"veri well, sair, I sal go&mdash;but,"&mdash;shaking his finger very
significantly at the landlord and lawyer, "I com' back to-morrow
morning, I buy dis prop-er-tee; you, sir, sal make
de deed in my name&mdash;I kick you out, sair, (to the landlord,)
and to you (the lawyer), I sal like de goose. Booh!"</p>

<p>With this, the poor old Frenchman started for his gig,
amid the "Haw! haw! haw! and ha! ha! he! he!"
of the landlord and lawyer. "That for you," said the
Frenchman, as he gave the surly Dutchman-hostler a real
half-dollar, took the dirty "ribbons" and drove off. Now,
the farmer, one of the three spectators present, had quietly
watched the proceedings, and being <i>gifted</i> with enough insight
into human nature to see something more than "an
old French barber" in the person and manner of the traveller;
and, moreover, being interested in the Tavern property,
followed the Frenchman; overtaking him, he at once
offered him the hospitalities of his domicile, not far distant,
where the traveller passed a most comfortable night, and
where his host found out that he was entertaining no less a
pecuniary miracle of his time&mdash;<i>than Stephen Girard</i>.</p>

<p>Early next morning, old Stephy, in his old and <i>shady</i>
gig, accompanied by his entertainer, rode over to the two
owners of the Tavern property, and with them sought the
<i>lawyer</i>, the deeds were made out, the old Frenchman <i>drew</i>
on his own Bank for the $13,000, gave the farmer a ten
years' <i>lease</i> upon the place, paid the lawyer for his trouble,
and as that worthy accompanied the millionaire to the door,
and was very obsequiously bowing him out, old Stephy
turned around on the steps, and looking sharp&mdash;with his one
eye upon the lawyer, says he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sair! Pooh! pooh!&mdash;<i>Booh!</i>" off he rode for the
Tavern, where he and the landlord had a <i>haze</i>, the landlord
was notified to <i>leave</i>, short metre; and being fully revenged
for the insult paid his millions, old Stephen Girard, the
great Philadelphia financier, rode back to where he was
better used for his money, and evidently better satisfied than
ever, that money is mighty when brought to bear upon an object!</p>

<h2><a name="Circumlocutory_Egg_Pedler" id="Circumlocutory_Egg_Pedler"></a>A Circumlocutory Egg Pedler.</h2>


<p>We have been, frequently, much amused with the
man&oelig;uvring of some folks in trade. It's not your
cute folks, who screw, twist and twirl over a smooth fourpence,
or skin a flea for its hide and tallow, and spoil a knife
that cost a shilling,&mdash;that come out first best in the long
run. Some folks have a weakness for beating down shop-keepers,
or anybody else they deal with, and so far have we
seen this <i>infirmity</i> carried, that we candidly believe we've
known persons that would not stop short of cheapening
the passage to kingdom come, if they thought a dollar and
two cents might be saved in the fare! Now the <i>rationale</i>
of the matter is this:&mdash;as soon as persons establish a reputation
for meanness&mdash;beating down folks, they fall victims
to all sorts of shaves and short commons, and have the fine
Saxony drawn over their eyes&mdash;from the nose to the occiput;
they get the meanest "bargains," offals, &amp;c., that
others would hardly have, even at a heavy discount. Then
some folks are so wonderful sharp, too, that we wonder
their very shadow does not often cut somebody. A friend
of ours went to buy his wife a pair of gaiters; he brought
them home; she found all manner of fault with them;
among other drawbacks, she declared that for the price her
better half had given for the gaiters, <i>she</i> could have got
the best article in Waxend's entire shop! <i>He</i> said <i>she</i>
had better take them back and try. So she did, and poor
Mr. Waxend had an hour of his precious time used up by
the lady's attempt to get a more expensive pair of gaiters
at a less price than those purchased by her husband. Waxend
saw how matters stood, so he consented to adopt the
maxim of&mdash;when Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war!</p>

<p>"Now, marm," said he, "here is a pair of gaiters I have
made for Mrs. Heavypurse; they are just your fit, most expensive
material, the best article in the shop; Mrs. Heavypurse
will not expect them for a few days, and rather than
<i>you</i> should be disappointed, I will let <i>you</i> have them for
the same price your husband paid for those common ones!"</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; took them, went home in great
glee, and told her better half she'd never trust him to go
shopping for her again&mdash;for they always cheated him.
When the husband came to scrutinize his wife's bargain,
lo! he detected the self-same gaiters&mdash;merely with a different
quality of lacings in them! He, like a philosopher,
grinned and said nothing. That illustrates one phase in
the character of some people who "go it blind" on "bargains"
and now, for the pith of our story&mdash;the way some
folks have of going round "Robin Hood's barn" to come
at a thing.</p>

<p>The other day we stopped into a friend's store to see how
he was getting along, and presently in came a rural-district-looking customer.</p>

<p>"How'd do?" says he, to the storekeeper, who was
busy, keeping the stove warm.</p>

<p>"Pretty well; how is it with you?"</p>

<p>"Well, so, so; how's all the folks?"</p>

<p>"Middling&mdash;middling, sir. How's all your folks?"</p>

<p>"Tolerable&mdash;yes, tolerable," says the rural gent. "How's
trade?" he ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>"Dull, ray-ther dull," responded the storekeeper. "Come
take a seat by the stove, Mr. Smallpotatoes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I guess not," says the ruralite. "Your
folks are all stirring, eh?" he added.</p>

<p>"Yes, stirring around a little, sir. How's your mother
got?" the storekeeper inquired, for it appeared he knew
the man.</p>

<p>"Poorly, dreadful poorly, yet," was the reply. "Cold
weather, you see, sort o' sets the old lady back."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," responded our friend; and here, think's
we, if there is anything important or business like on the
man's mind, he must be near to its focus. But he started again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ain't goin' to Californy, then, are you?" says Mr. Smallpotatoes.</p>

<p>"Guess not," said our friend. "You talked of going, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Well, ye-e-e-s, I did think of it," said the rural gent;
"I did think of it last fall, but I kind o' gin it up."</p>

<p>Here another <i>hiatus</i> occurred; the rural gent walked
around, viewed the goods and chattels for some minutes;
then says he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Guess I'll be movin'," and of course that called forth
from our friend the venerated expression&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's your hurry?"</p>

<p>"Well, nothing 'special. Plaguy cold winter we've got!"</p>

<p>"That's a fact," answered the storekeeper. "How's
sleighing out your way&mdash;good?"</p>

<p>"First rate; I guess the folks have had enough of it,
this winter, by jolly. I hev, any how," says the rural gent.
"Trade's dull, eh?"</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;very <i>slack</i>."</p>

<p>"Dullest time of the year, I reckon, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much so, indeed," says the storekeeper.</p>

<p>"I don't see's Californy goold gets much plentier, or
business much better, nowhere."</p>

<p>To this bit of cogent reason our friend replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not much&mdash;that's a fact."</p>

<p>"I 'spect there's a good deal of humbug about the
Californy goold mines, don't you?"</p>

<p>"The wealth of the country or the ease of coming at it,"
said the storekeeper, "is no doubt exaggerated some."</p>

<p>"That's my opinion on't too," said the agriculturist.
"Some make money out there, and then agin some don't;
I reckon more don't than does." To this bright inference
the storekeeper ventured to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think it's highly <i>probable</i>."</p>

<p>"All your folks are lively, eh?" inquired Smallpotatoes.</p>

<p>"Pretty much so," said the storekeeper; "troubled a
little with influenza, colds, &amp;c.; nothing serious, however."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"All your folks are well, I believe you said?" the storekeeper,
in apparent solicitude, inquired, to be reassured
of the fact.</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-s, exceptin' the old lady."</p>

<p>Another pause; we began to feel convinced there was
speculation in the rural gent's "eyes," and just for the fun
of the thing&mdash;as we "were up" to such dodges&mdash;we determined
to hang on and see how he come out.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, I must be goin'!" suddenly said the
rural gent, and actually made five steps towards the handle
of the door.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry," echoed the storekeeper. "When
did you come in town?"</p>

<p>"I come in this mornin'."</p>

<p>"Any of the folks in with you?"</p>

<p>"No; my wife did want to come in, but concluded it was
too cold; 'spected some of your folks out to see us durin'
this good sleighing&mdash;why didn't you come?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't very well spare time," said the storekeeper.</p>

<p>"Well, we'd been glad to see you, and if you get time,
and the sleighin' holds out, you must come and see us."</p>

<p>"I may&mdash;I can't promise for certain."</p>

<p>Now another pause took place, and thinks we&mdash;the climax
has come, surely, after all that small talk. The country
gent walked deliberately to the door; he actually took hold
of the knob.</p>

<p>"You off?" says the storekeeper.</p>

<p>"B'lieve I'll be off"&mdash;opening the door, then rushes
back again&mdash;semi-excited by the force of some pent up
idea, says the rural gent&mdash;"O! Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, <i>don't you want
to buy some good fresh eggs</i>?"</p>

<p>"Eggs? Yes, I do; been looking all around for some
fresh eggs; how many have you?"</p>

<p>"Five dozen; thought you'd want some; so I come right in to see!"</p>

<p>We nearly catapillered! After all this circumlocution,
the man came to the <i>pint</i>, and&mdash;sold his eggs in two minutes!</p>

<p>Either mankind or his constitution has changed since
"the good old times," for we read in an old medicine book,
that bleeding at the nose, and cramp, could be effectually
prevented by wearing a dried toad in a bag at the pit of
the stomach; while for rheumatism and consumption, a
snake skin worn in the crown of your hat, was a sovereign
remedy! Dried toads and snake skins are quite out of use
around these settlements, and we think the Esculapius who
would recommend such nostrums, would be looked upon as
a poor devil with a fissure in his cranium, liable to cause his
brains to become weather-beaten! We remember hearing of
a learned old cuffy, who lived down "dar" near Tallahassee,
who invariably recommended cayenne pepper in the eye to
cure the toothache! Had this venerable old colored gem'n

cutest and all firedest <i>tight</i> critters on the face of the <i>yearth</i>,
when money or trade's in the question&mdash;are "<i>done</i>" now and
then, upon the most scientific principles, we are going to prove.</p>

<p>It is generally known, in the newspaper world, that two
or three Eastern men, a few years ago, started a paper in
Philadelphia, upon the penny principle, and have since
been rewarded as they deserved. They were, and are,
men of great enterprise and liberality, as far as their
business is concerned, and thereby they got ahead of all
competition, and made their <i>pile</i>. The proprietors were
always "fly" for any new dodge, by which they could keep
the lead of things, and monopolize the <i>news</i> market. The
Telegraph had not "turned up" in the day of which we
write&mdash;the <i>mails</i>, and, now and then, express horse lines,
were the media through which <i>Great Excitements! Alarming
Events!! Great Fires and Awful Calamities!!</i> were
come at. One morning, as one of these gentlemen was
sitting in his office, a long, lank genius, with a visage as
hatchet-faced and keen as any Connecticut Yankee's on
record, came in, and inquired of one of the clerks for
the proprietors of that institution. Being pointed out,
the thin man made a <i>lean</i> towards him. After getting
close up, and twisting and screwing around his head to see
that nobody was listening or looking, the lean man sat
down very gingerly upon the extreme verge of a chair, and
leaning forward until his razor-made nose almost touched
that of the publisher, in a low, nasal, anxious tone, says he,</p>

<p>"Air yeou one of the publishers of this paper?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeou, sir!" said the visitor, again looking suspiciously
around and about him.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear tell of the <i>Pigeon Express</i>?" he continued.</p>

<p>"The Pigeon Express?" echoed the publisher.</p>

<p>"Ya-a-s. Carrier pigeons&mdash;letters to their l-e-g-s and
newspapers under their wings&mdash;trained to fly any where
you warnt 'em."</p>

<p>"Carrier Pigeons," mused the publisher&mdash;"Carrier&mdash;pigeons
trained to carry billets&mdash;bulletins and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go frum fifty to a hundred miles an hour!" chimed in
the stranger.</p>

<p>"True, so they say, very true," continued the publisher, musingly.</p>

<p>"Elegant things for gettin' or sendin' noos head of every body else."</p>

<p>"Precisely: that's a fact, that's a fact," the other responded,
rising from his chair and pacing the floor, as
though rather and decidedly <i>taken</i> by the novelty and feasibility
of the operation.</p>

<p>"You'd have 'em all, Mister, dead as mutton, by a Pigeon Express."</p>

<p>"I like the idea; good, first rate!"</p>

<p>"Can't be beat, noheow!" said the stranger.</p>

<p>"But what would it cost?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred dollars, and a small wagon, to begin on."</p>

<p>"A small wagon?"</p>

<p>"Ya-a-s. Yeou see, Mister, the birds haff to be trained
to fly from one <i>pint</i> to another!"</p>

<p>"Yes; well?"</p>

<p>"Wa-a-ll, yeou see the birds are put in a box, on the
top of the bildin', for a spell, teu git the <i>hang</i> of things,
and so on!"</p>

<p>"Yes, very well; go on."</p>

<p>"Then the birds are put in a cage, the trainer takes 'em
into his wagon&mdash;ten miles at first&mdash;throws 'em up, and the
birds go to the bildin'. Next day fifteen miles, and so forth; yeou see?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; I understand; now, where can these birds be had?"</p>

<p>Putting his thin lips close to the publisher's opening
ears, in a low, long way, says the stranger&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I've got 'em!</i> R-a-l-e Persian birds&mdash;be-e-utis!"</p>

<p>"You understand training them?" says the anxious publisher.</p>

<p>"<i>Like a book</i>," the stranger responded.</p>

<p>"Where are the birds?" the publisher inquired.</p>

<p>"I've got 'em down to the tavern, where I'm stoppin'."</p>

<p>"Bring them up; let me see them; let me see them!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mister, of course," responded the Pigeon express
man, leaving the presence of the tickled-to-death publisher,
who paced his office as full of effervescence as a
jimmyjohn of spruce beer in dog days.</p>

<p>About this time pigeons were being trained, and in a few
cases, now and then, really did carry messages for lottery ticket
venders in Jersey City, to Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore;
but these exploits rarely paid first cost, and did not
amount to much, although some noise was made about the
wonderful performance of certain Carrier Pigeons. But
the <i>paper</i> was to have a new impulse&mdash;astonish all creation
and the rest of mankind, by Pigeon Express. The
publisher's partner was in New York, fishing for novelties,
and he determined to astonish him, on his return home,
by the <i>bird business!</i> A coop was fixed on the top of the
"bildin'," as the great inventor of the express had
suggested. The wagon was bought, and, with two hundred
dollars in for funds, passed over to the pigeon express man,
who, in the course of a few days, takes the birds into his
wagon, to take them out some few miles, throw them up, and
the publisher and a confidential friend were to be on top
of the "bildin'," looking out for them.</p>

<p>They kept looking!&mdash;they saw something werry like a
whale, but a good deal like a first-rate bad "<i>Sell!</i>" The
lapse of a few days was quite sufficient to convince the
publisher that he had been taken in and done for&mdash;regularly
<i>picked up</i> and done for,&mdash;upon the most approved and
scientific principles. Rather than let the cat out of the bag,
he made up his mind to pocket the <i>shave</i> and keep shady,
not even "letting on to his partner," who in the course
of the following week returned from Gotham, evidently
feeling as fine as silk, about something or other.</p>

<p>"Well, what's new in New York&mdash;got hold of any thing
rich?" was the first interrogatory.</p>

<p>"Hi-i-i-sh! close the door!" was the reply, indicating
something very important on the <i>tapis</i>.</p>

<p>"So; my dear fellow, I've got a concern, now, that will
put the sixpennies to sleep as sound as rocks!"</p>

<p>"No. What have you started in Gotham?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. If you don't own up the corn, that the idea
is grand&mdash;immense&mdash;I'll knock under."</p>

<p>"Good! I'm glad&mdash;particularly glad you've found something
new and startling," responded the other. "Well,
what is it?"</p>

<p>"Great!&mdash;wonderful!&mdash;<i>Carrier Pigeons!</i>"</p>

<p>"What! Pigeons?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pigeons!</i>"</p>

<p>"You don't pretend to say that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, all arranged&mdash;luckiest fellows alive, we are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be uneasy&mdash;I fixed it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm hanged if this isn't rich!" muttered his
partner, sticking his digits into his trowserloons&mdash;biting his
lips and stamping around.</p>

<p>"Rich! <i>elegant!</i> In two weeks we'll be flying our birds and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Flying! Why, do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! I knew I'd astonish you; Tom insisted on
my keeping perfectly <i>mum</i>, until things were in regular
working order; he then set the boys to work&mdash;we have
large cages on top of the building&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come up on top of this building," said the partner, solemnly.
"There, do you see that bundle of laths and stuff?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, you don't pretend to say that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do exactly; a scamp came along here a week ago&mdash;talked
nothing but Carrier Pigeons&mdash;Pigeon Expresses&mdash;I
thought I'd surprise you, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"And by thunder I was green enough to give the fellow
$200&mdash;a horse and wagon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Done! <i>done!</i>" roared the other, without waiting for
further particulars&mdash;"$200 and a horse and wagon&mdash;just
what Tom and I gave the scamp! ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! haw!" and the publishers roared under
the force of the <i>joke</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever became of the pigeon express man is not distinctly
known; but he is supposed to have given up the bird
business, and gone into the manufacture of woolly horses
and cod-liver oil.</p>

<h2><a name="Great_Dinner_Party" id="Great_Dinner_Party"></a>Jipson's Great Dinner Party.</h2>


<p>"Well, you must do it."</p>

<p>"Do it?"</p>

<p>"Do it, sir," reiterated the lady of Jipson, a man well
enough to <i>do</i> in the world, chief clerk of a "sugar baker,"
and receiving his twenty hundred dollars a year, with no
perquisites, however, and&mdash;plenty of New Hampshire contingencies,
(to quote our beloved man of the million, Theodore
Parker,) poor relations.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Betsey, do you <i>know</i>, will you consider
for once, that to <i>do</i> a thing of the kind&mdash;to splurge out like
Tannersoil, one must expect&mdash;at least I do&mdash;to sink a full
<i>quarter</i> of my salary, for the current year; yes, a full quarter?"</p>

<p>"Oh! very well, if you are going to live up here" (Jipson
had just moved up above "Bleecker street,")&mdash;"and bought
your carriage, and engaged&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two extra servant girls," chimed in Jipson.</p>

<p>"And a groom, sir," continued Mrs. J.</p>

<p>"And gone into at least six hundred to eight hundred
dollars a year extra expenses, to&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To gratify yourself, and&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;your vanity, Madam, you should have
said, my dear."</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way to me&mdash;to me&mdash;you brute; you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all about it, my dear."</p>

<p>"<i>My dear</i>&mdash;bah!" said the lady; "my <i>dear!</i> save that,
Mr. Jipson, for some of your&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>What Mrs. J. might have said, we scarce could judge;
but Jipson just then put in a "rejoinder" calculated to
prevent the umpullaceous tone of Mrs. J.'s remarks, by
saying, in a very humble strain&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jipson, don't make an ass of yourself: we are too
old to act like goslings, and too well acquainted, I hope,
with the matters-of-fact of every-day life, to quarrel about
things beyond our reach or control."</p>

<p>"If you talk of things beyond your control, Mr. Jipson,
I mean beyond your reach, that your income will not permit
us to live as other people live&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to," interposed Jipson.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Mrs. Jipson.</p>

<p>"Live like other people&mdash;that is, some people, Mrs.
Jipson, that I know of."</p>

<p>"You don't suppose <i>I'm</i> going to bury myself and my
poor girls in this big house, and have those servants standing
about me, their fingers in their mouths, with nothing to do but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"But cook, and worry, and slave, and keep shut up for a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. J. was stuck. Jipson saw that; he divined
what a <i>point</i> Mrs. J. was about to, but could not conscientiously
make, so he relieved her with&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Betsey, it's a popular fallacy, an exploded
idea, a contemptible humbug, to live merely for your neighbors,
the rabble world at large. Thousands do it, my dear,
and I've no objection to their doing it; it's their own business,
and none of mine. I have moved up town because I
thought it would be more pleasant; I bought a modest
kind of family carriage because I could afford it, and believed
it would add to our recreations and health; the carriage
and horses required care; I engaged a man to attend
to them, fix up the garden, and be useful generally, and
added a girl or two to your domestic departments, in order to
lighten your own cares, &amp;c. Now, all this, my dear woman,
you ought to know, rests a very important responsibility
upon my shoulders, health, life, and&mdash;two thousand dollars
a year, and if you imagine it compatible with common sense,
or consonant with my judgment, to make an ass or fool of
myself, by going into the extravagances and tom-fooleries
of Tannersoil, our neighbor over the way, who happens for
the time to be 'under government,' with a salary of nothing
to speak of, but with stealings equal to those of a successful
freebooter, you&mdash;you&mdash;you have placed a&mdash;a bad estimate
upon my common sense, Madam."</p>

<p>With this flaring burst of eloquence, Jipson seized his
hat, gloves and cane, and soon might be seen an elderly,
natty, well-shaved, slightly-flushed gentleman taking his
seat in a down town bound <i>bus</i>, en route for the sugar
bakery of the firm of Cutt, Comeagain, &amp; Co. It was
evident, however, from the frequency with which Jipson
plied his knife and rubber to his "figgers" of the day's
accounts, and the tremulousness with which he drove the
porcupine quill, that Jipson was thinking of something else!</p>

<p>"Mr. Jipson, I wish you'd square up that account of
Look, Sharp, &amp; Co., to-day," said Mr. Cutt, entering the
counting room.</p>

<p>"All folly!" said Jipson, scratching out a mistake from
his day-book, and not heeding the remark, though he saw
the person of his employer.</p>

<p>"Eh?" was the ejaculation of Cutt.</p>

<p>"All folly!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, sir!" said Cutt, in utter astonishment.</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg pardon, sir," said poor Jipson; "I beg
pardon, sir. Engrossed in a little affair of my own, I quite
overlooked your observation. I will attend to the account
of Look, Sharp, &amp; Co., at once, sir;" and while Jipson was
at it, his employer went out, wondering what in faith could
be the matter with Jipson, a man whose capacity and gentlemanly
deportment the firm had tested to their satisfaction
for many years previous. The little <i>incident</i> was mentioned
to the partner, Comeagain. The firm first laughed, then
wondered what was up to disturb the usual equilibrium of
Jipson, and ended by hoping he hadn't taken to drink or nothing!</p>

<p>"Guess I'd better do it," soliloquizes Jipson. "My wife
is a good woman enough, but like most women, lets her
vanity trip up her common sense, now and then; she feels
cut down to know that Tannersoil's folks are plunging out
with dinners and evening parties, troops of company, piano
going, and bawling away their new fol-de-rol music. Yes,
guess I'll do it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jipson little calculates the horrors&mdash;not only in a
pecuniary, but domestic sense&mdash;that these dinners, suppers
and parties to the rag-tag and bobtail, cost many honest-meaning
people, who <i>ought</i> to be ashamed of them.</p>

<p>"But, I'll do it, if it costs me the whole quarter's salary!"</p>

<p>A few days were sufficient to concoct details and arrange
the programme. When Mrs. Jipson discovered, as she
vainly supposed, the prevalence of "better sense" on the
part of her husband, she was good as cranberry tart, and
flew around in the best of humor, to hurry up the event
that was to give <i>eclat</i> to the new residence and family of
the Jipsons, slightly dim the radiance or mushroom glory
of the Tannersoil family, and create a commotion generally&mdash;above
Bleecker street!</p>

<p>Jipson <i>drew</i> on his employers, for a quarter's salary.
The draft was honored, of course, but it led to some <i>speculation</i>
on the part of "the firm," as to what Jipson was up
to, and whether he wasn't getting into evil habits, and decidedly
bad economy in his old age. Jipson talked, Mrs.
Jipson talked. Their almost&mdash;in fact, Mrs. J., like most
ambitious mothers, thought, <i>really</i>&mdash;marriageable daughters
dreamed and talked dinner parties for the full month,
ere the great event of their lives came duly off.</p>

<p>One of the seeming difficulties was who to invite&mdash;who
to get to come, and <i>where</i> to get them! Now, originally,
the Jipsons were from the "Hills of New Hampshire, of
poor but respectable" birth. Fifteen years in the great
metropolis had not created a very extensive acquaintance
among solid folks; in fact, New York society fluctuates,
ebbs and flows at such a rate, that society&mdash;such as domestic
people might recognize as unequivocally genteel&mdash;is hard to
fasten to or find. But one of the Miss Jipsons possessed
an acquaintance with a Miss Somebody else, whose brother
was a young gentleman of very <i>distingue</i> air, and who knew
the entire "ropes" of fashionable life, and people who enjoyed
that sort of existence in the gay metropolis.</p>

<p>Mr. Theophilus Smith, therefore, was eventually engaged.
It was his, as many others' vocation, to arrange details,
command the feast, select the company, and control the
coming event. The Jipsons confined their invitations to
the few, very few genteel of the family, and even the diminutiveness
of the number invited was decimated by Mr. Smith,
who was permitted to review the parties invited.</p>

<p>Few domiciles&mdash;of civilian, "above Bleecker st.,"&mdash;were
better illuminated, set off and detailed than that of Jipson,
on the evening of the ever-memorable dinner. Smith had
volunteered to "engage" a whole set of silver from Tinplate
&amp; Co., who generously offer our ambitious citizens
such opportunities to splurge, for a fair consideration;
while china, porcelain, a dozen colored waiters in white
aprons, with six plethoric fiddlers and tooters, were also in
Smith's programme. Jipson at first was puzzled to know
where he could find volunteers to fill two dozen chairs, but
when night came, Mr. Theophilus Smith, by force of tactics
truly wonderful, drummed in a force to face a gross of
plates, napkins and wine glasses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jipson was evidently astonished, the Misses J. not
a little vexed at the "raft" of elegant ladies present, and
the independent manner in which they monopolized attention
and made themselves at home.</p>

<p>Jipson swore inwardly, and looked like "a sorry man."
Smith was at home, in his element; he was head and foot
of the party. Himself and friends soon led and ruled the
feast. The band struck up; the corks flew, the wine <i>fizzed</i>,
the ceilings were spattered, and the walls tattooed with
Burgundy, Claret and Champagne!</p>

<p>"To our host!" cries Smith.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ah! 'ere's&mdash;ah! to our a&mdash;our host!" echoes
another swell, already insolently "corned."</p>

<p>"Where the&mdash;a&mdash;where is our worthy host?" says
another specimen of "above Bleecker street" genteel society.
"I&mdash;a say, trot out your host, and let's give the
old fellow a toast!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! b-wavo! b-wavo!" exclaimed a dozen shot-in-the-neck
bloods, spilling their wine over the carpets, one
another, and table covers.</p>

<p>"This is intolerable!" gasps poor Jipson, who was in
the act of being kept <i>cool</i> by his wife, in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Jipson&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! there's the old fellaw!" cries one of the swells.</p>

<p>"I-ah&mdash;say, Mister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Old roostaw, I say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" roars Jipson, rushing forward, elevating
his voice and fists.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake! Jipson," cries the wife.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, or bla'guards, as you are."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! Jipson, will you hear me?" imploringly cries
Mrs. Jipson.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;ah&mdash;are you at? Does he&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, what&mdash;ah&mdash;does old Jip say?"</p>

<p>"Who the deuce, old What's-your-name, do you call
gentlemen?" chimes in a third.</p>

<p>"Bla'guards!" roars Jipson.</p>

<p>"Oh, veri well, veri well, old fellow, we&mdash;ah&mdash;are&mdash;ah&mdash;to
blame for&mdash;ah&mdash;patronizing a snob," continues a swell.</p>

<p>"A what?" shouts Jipson.</p>

<p>"A plebeian!"</p>

<p>"A codfish&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Villains! scoundrels! bla'guards!" shouts the outraged
Jipson, rushing at the intoxicated swells, and hitting right
and left, upsetting chairs, tables, and lamps.</p>

<p>"Murder!" cries a knocked down guest.</p>

<p>"E-e-e-e-e-e!" scream the ladies.</p>

<p>"Don't! E-e-e-e! don't kill my father!" screams the daughter.</p>

<p>Chairs and hats flew; the negro servants and Dutch
fiddlers, only engaged for the occasion, taking no interest
in a free fight, and not caring two cents who whipped, laid back and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yaw! ha! ha! De lor'! Yaw! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jipson fainted; ditto two others of the family; the
men folks (!) began to travel; the ladies (!) screamed;
called for their hats, shawls, and <i>chaperones</i>,&mdash;the most of the
latter, however, were <i>non est</i>, or too well "set up," to heed
the common state of affairs.</p>

<p>Jipson finally cleared the house. Silence reigned within
the walls for a week. In the interim, Mrs. Jipson and the
daughters not only got over their hysterics, but ideas of
gentility, as practised "above Bleecker street." It took
poor Jipson an entire year to recuperate his financial
"outs," while it took the whole family quite as long to get
over their grand debut as followers of fashion in the great metropolis.</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="for_them_Lobsters" id="for_them_Lobsters"></a>Look out for them Lobsters.</h2>


<p>Deacon &mdash;&mdash;, who resides in a pleasant village inside
of an hour's ride upon Fitchburg road, rejoices
in a fondness for the long-tailed <i>crustacea</i>, vulgarly known
as lobsters. And, from messes therewith fulminated, by
<i>some</i> of our professors of gastronomics that we have seen,
we do not attach any wonder at all to the deacon's penchant
for the aforesaid shell-fish. The deacon had been
disappointed several times by assertions of the lobster merchants,
who, in their overwhelming zeal to effect a sale, had
been a little too sanguine of the precise <i>time</i> said lobsters
were caught and boiled; hence, after lugging home a ten
pound specimen of the vasty deep, miles out into the quiet
country, the deacon was often sorely vexed to find the lobster
no better than it should be!</p>

<p>"Why don't you get them alive, deacon?" said a friend,&mdash;"get
them alive and kicking, deacon; boil them yourself;
be sure of their freshness, and have them cooked more
carefully and properly."</p>

<p>"Well said," quoth the deacon; "so I can, for they sell
them, I observe, near the depot,&mdash;right out of the boat.
I'm much obliged for the notion."</p>

<p>The next visit of the good deacon to Boston,&mdash;as he was
about to return home, he goes to the bridge and bargains
for two live lobsters, fine, active, lusty-clawed fellows, alive
and kicking, and no mistake!</p>

<p>"But what will I do with them?" says the deacon to
the purveyor of the <i>crustacea</i>, as he gazed wistfully upon
the two sprawling, ugly, green and scratching lobsters, as
they lay before him upon the planks at his feet.</p>

<p>"Do with 'em?" responded the lobster merchant,&mdash;"why,
bile 'em and eat 'em! I bet you a dollar you never
ate better lobsters 'n them, nohow, mister!"</p>

<p>The deacon looked anxiously and innocently at the
speaker, as much as to say&mdash;"you don't say so?"</p>

<p>"I mean, friend, how shall I get them home?"</p>

<p>"O," says the lobster merchant, "that's easy enough;
here, Saul," says he, calling up a frizzle-headed lad in blue
pants&mdash;<i>sans</i> hat or boots, and but one <i>gallows</i> to his
breeches, "here, you, light upon these lobsters and carry
'em home for this old gentleman."</p>

<p>"Goodness, bless you," says the deacon; "why friend, I
reside ten miles out in the country!"</p>

<p>"O, the blazes you do!" says the lobster merchant;
"well, I tell you, Saul can carry 'em to the cars for you in
this 'ere bag, if you're goin' out?"</p>

<p>"Truly, he can," quoth the deacon; "and Saul can go
right along with me."</p>

<p>The lobsters were dashed into a piece of Manilla sack,
thrown across the shoulders of the juvenile Saul, and away
they went at the heels of the deacon, to the depot; here
Saul dashed down the "poor creturs" until their bones or
shells rattled most piteously, and as the deacon handed a
"three cent piece" to Saul, the long and wicked claw of
one of the lobsters protruded out of the bag&mdash;opened and
shut with a <i>clack</i>, that made the deacon shudder!</p>

<p>"Those fellows are plaguy awkward to handle, are they
not, my son?" says the deacon.</p>

<p>"Not <i>werry</i>," says the boy; "they can't bite, cos you
see they's got pegs down here&mdash;<i>hallo!</i>" As Saul poked his
hand down towards the big claw lying partly out of the
open-mouthed bag, the claw opened, and <i>clacked</i> at his fingers,
ferocious as a mad dog.</p>

<p>"His peg's out," said the boy&mdash;"and I can't fasten it;
but here's a chunk of twine; tie the bag and they can't get
out, any how, and you kin put 'em into yer pot right out of
the bag."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," says the deacon; "I guess I will take care
of them; bring them here; there, just place the bag right
in under my seat; so, that will do."</p>

<p>Presently the cars began to fill up, as the minute of departure
approached, and soon every seat around the worthy
deacon was occupied. By-and-by, "a middle-aged lady,"
in front of the deacon, began to <i>fussle</i> about and twist
around, as if anxious to arrange the great amplitude of her
<i>drapery</i>, and look after something "bothering" her feet.
In front of the lady, sat a <i>slab</i>-sided <i>genus</i> dandy, fat as a
match and quite as good looking; between his legs sat a
pale-face dog, with a flashing collar of brass and tinsel,
quite as gaudy as his master's neck-choker; this canine gave
an awful&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Ihk!</i> ow, yow! yow-oo&mdash;yow, ook! yow! <i>yow!</i> <span class="smcap">yow</span>!"</p>

<p>"Lor' a massy!" cries the woman in front of the deacon,
jumping up, and making a desperate splurge to get up on
to the seats, and in the effort upsetting sundry bundles and
parcels around her!</p>

<p>"Yow-<i>ook!</i> Yow-<i>ook!</i>" yelled the dog, jumping clear
out of the grasp of the juvenile <i>Mantillini</i>, and dashing
himself on to the head and shoulders of the next seat occupants,
one of whom was a sturdy civilized Irishman, who
made "no bones" in grasping the sickly-looking dog, and
to the horror and alarm of the entire female party present,
he sung out:</p>

<p>"Whur-r-r ye about, ye brute! Is the divil <i>mad</i>?"</p>

<p>"Eee! Ee! O dear! O! O!" cries an anxious mother.</p>

<p>"O! O! O-o-o! save us from the dog!" cries another.</p>

<p>"Whur-r-r-r! ye <i>divil!</i>" cries the Irish gintilman,
pinning the poor dog down between the seats, with a force that
extracted another glorious yell.</p>

<p>"Ike! Ike! Ike! oo, ow! ow! Ike! Ike! Ike!"</p>

<p>"Murder! mur-r-r-der!" bawls another victim in the
rear of the deacon, leaping up in his seat, and rubbing his
leg vigorously.</p>

<p>"What on airth's loose?" exclaims one.</p>

<p>"Halloo! what's that?" cries another, hastily vacating
his seat and crowding towards the door.</p>

<p>"O dear, O! O!" anxiously cries a delicate young lady.</p>

<p>"What? who? where?" screamed a dozen at once.</p>

<p>"Good <i>conscience!</i>" exclaims the deacon, as he dropped
his newspaper, in the midst of the din&mdash;noise and confusion;
and with a most singular and spasmodic effort to
dance a "<i>high</i>land fling," he hustled out of his seat, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Good conscience, I really believe they're out."</p>

<p>"Eh? What&mdash;what's out?" cries one.</p>

<p>"Snakes!" echoes an old gentleman, grasping a cane.</p>

<p>"Snappin' turtles, Mister?" inquire several.</p>

<p>"Snakes!" cried a dozen.</p>

<p>"Snappers!" echoes a like quantity of the dismayed.</p>

<p>"Snapper-r-r-r-rs!"</p>

<p>"Snake-e-e-es!" O what a din!</p>

<p>"Halloo! here, what's all this? What's the matter?"
says the conductor, coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>"That man's got snakes in the car!" roar several at once.</p>

<p>"And snappin' turtles, too, consarn him!" says one,
while all eyes were directed, tongues wagging, and hands
gesticulating furiously at the astonished deacon.</p>

<p>"Take care of them! Take care of them! I believe
I'm bitten clear through my boot&mdash;catch them, Mr. Swallow!"
cries the deacon.</p>

<p>"Swallow 'em, Mr. Catcher!" echoes the frightened dandy.</p>

<p>"What? where?" says the excited conductor, looking around.</p>

<p>"Here, here, in under these seats, sir,&mdash;<i>my lobsters,
sir</i>," says the deacon, standing aloof to let the conductor
and the man with the cane get at the <i>reptiles</i>, as the latter insisted.</p>

<p>"Darn 'em, are they only lobsters!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! Lobsters!" says young Mantillini, with a
mock heroic shrug of his shoulders, and looking fierce as
two cents!</p>

<p>"Come out here!" says the conductor, feeling for them.</p>

<p>"Take care!" says the deacon, "the plaguy things have
got their pins out!"</p>

<p>"Why, they are <i>alive</i>, and crawling around; hear the
old fellow,&mdash;take care, Mr. Swaller&mdash;he's cross as sin!"
says the man with the cane&mdash;"wasn't that a <i>snap</i>? Take
care! You got him?" that indefatigable assistant continued,
rattling his tongue and cane.</p>

<p>"I've got them!" cries the conductor.</p>

<p>"Put them in the bag, here, sir," says the deacon.</p>

<p>"Take them out of this car!" cries everybody.</p>

<p>"Plaguy things," says the deacon. "I sha'n't never buy
another <i>live lobster!</i>"</p>

<p>Order was restored, passengers took their seats, but
when young Mantillini looked for his dog, he had vamosed
with the <i>Irishman</i>, at "the last stopping place," in his excitement,
leaving a quart jug of whiskey in lieu of the dandy's dog.</p>

<p>"Well, well, drum no more about it, for mercy's
sake; if you must go, you must <i>go</i>, that's all."</p>

<p>"Yes, just like you, Fitzfaddle"&mdash;pettishly reiterates the
lady of the middle-aged man of business; "mention any
thing that would be gratifying to the children&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The children&mdash;<i>umph!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, the children; only mention taking the dear, tied-up
souls to, to&mdash;to the Springs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Haven't</i> they been to Saratoga? <i>Didn't</i> I spend a month
of my precious time and a thousand of my precious dollars
there, four years ago, to be physicked, cheated, robbed,
worried, starved, and&mdash;laughed at?" Fitzfaddle responds.</p>

<p>"Or, to the sea-side&mdash;" continued the lady.</p>

<p>"Sea-side! good conscience!" exclaims Fitzfaddle; "my dear Sook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't call me <i>Sook</i>, Fitzfaddle; <i>Sook!</i> I'm not <i>in</i> the
kitchen, nor <i>of</i> the kitchen, you'll please remember, Fitzfaddle!"
said the lady, with evident feeling.</p>

<p>"O," echoed Fitz, "God bless me, Mrs. Fitzfaddle,
don't be so rabid; don't be foolish, in your old days; my
dear, we've spent the happiest of our days in the kitchen;
when we were first married, <i>Susan</i>, when our whole stock
in trade consisted of five ricketty chairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, that's enough about it&mdash;" interposed the lady.</p>

<p>"A plain old pine breakfast table&mdash;" continued Fitz.</p>

<p>"I'd stop, just <span class="smcap">there</span>&mdash;" scowlingly said Mrs. Fitz.</p>

<p>"My father's old chest, and your mother's old corner
cupboard&mdash;" persevered the indefatigable monster.</p>

<p>"I'd go through the whole inventory&mdash;" angrily cried
Mrs. Fitz&mdash;"clean down to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The few broken pots, pans, and dishes we had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you&mdash;<i>don't you feel ashamed of yourself</i>?" exclaims
Mrs. Fitz, about as full of anger as she could well
contain; but Fitz keeps the even tenor of his way.</p>

<p>"Not at all, my dear; Heaven forbid that I should ever
forget a jot of the real happiness of any portion of my life.
When you and I, dear Sook (an awful scowl, and a sudden
change of her position, on her costly rocking chair. Fitz
looked askance at Mrs. Fitz, and proceeded); when you
and I, <i>Susan</i>, lived in Dowdy's little eight by ten 'blue
frame,' down in Pigginsborough; not a yard of carpet, or
piece of mahogany, or silver, or silk, or satin, or flummery
of any sort, the five old chairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good conscience! are you going to have that over
again?" cries Mrs. Fitz, with the utmost chagrin.</p>

<p>"The old white pine table&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitz starts in horror.</p>

<p>"My father's old chest, and your mother's old corner cupboard!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitz, in an agony, walks the floor!</p>

<p>"The few broken or cracked pots, pans and dishes, we had&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nature quite "gin eout"&mdash;the exhausted Mrs. Fitzfaddle
throws herself down upon the sumptuous <i>conversazione</i>,
and absorbs her grief in the ample folds of a lace-wrought
handkerchief (bought at Warren's&mdash;cost the entire profits
of ten quintals of Fitzfaddle &amp; Co.'s A No. 1 cod!), while
the imperturbable Fitz drives on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your mother's old cooking stove, Susan&mdash;the time and
again, Susan, I've sat in that little kitchen&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzfaddle shudders all over. Each reminiscence,
so dear to Fitzfaddle, seems a dagger to her.</p>

<p>"With little Nanny&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you brute! You&mdash;you vulgar&mdash;you&mdash;you Fitzfaddle.
Nanny! to call your daughter N-Nanny!"</p>

<p>"Nanny! why, yes, Nanny&mdash;" says the matter-of-fact
head of the firm of Fitzfaddle &amp; Co. "I believe we did
intend to call the girl Nancy; we <i>did</i> call her Nanny, Mrs.
Fitzfaddle; but, like all the rest, by your innovations,
things have kept changing no better fast. I believe my
soul that girl has had five changes in her name before you
concluded it was up to the highest point of modern respectability.
From Nancy you had it Nannette, from Nannette
to Ninna, from Ninna to Naomi, and finally it was rested
at Anna Antoinette De Orville Fitzfaddle! Such a mess
of nonsense to <i>handle</i> my plain name."</p>

<p>"Anna Antoinette De Orville"&mdash;said Mrs. Fitz, suddenly
rallying, "<i>is</i> a name, only made <i>plain</i> by your ugly
and countryfied prefix. De Orville is a name," said the lady.</p>

<p>"I should like to know," said the old gentleman, "upon
what pretext, Mrs. Fitzfaddle, you lay claim to such a
Frenchy and flighty name or title as De Orville?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it my family name, you brute?" cried Mrs. Fitz.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho! Sook, Sook, <i>Sook</i>," says Fitzfaddle.</p>

<p>"<i>Sook!</i>" almost screams Mrs. Fitz.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>Sook</i>, Sook <i>Scovill</i>, daughter of a good old-fashioned,
patriotic farmer&mdash;<i>Timothy Scovill</i>, of Tanner's Mills,
in the county of Tuggs&mdash;down East. And when I married
Sook (Mrs. Fitz jumped up, a rustling of silk is heard&mdash;a
door slams, and the old gentleman finishes his domestic
narrative, <i>solus!</i>), she was as fine a gal as the State ever
produced. We were poor, and we knew it; wasn't discouraged
or put out, on the account of our poverty. We
started in the world square; happy as clams, nothing but
what was useful around us; it is a happy reflection to look
back upon those old chairs, pine table, my father's old chest,
and Sook's mother's old corner cupboard&mdash;the cracked pots
and pans&mdash;the old stove&mdash;Sook as ruddy and bright as a
full-blown rose, as she bent over the hot stove in our parlor,
dining room, and kitchen&mdash;turning her slap-jacks, frying,
baking and boiling, and I often by her side, with our first
child, Nanny, on my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope by this time you're over your vulgar Pigginsborough
recollections, Fitzfaddle!" exclaims Mrs. Fitz,
re-entering the parlor.</p>

<p>"I was just concluding, my dear, the happy time when
I sat and read to you, or held Nanny, while you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fitzfaddle, for goodness' sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"While you&mdash;ruddy and bright, my dear, as the full-blown
rose, bent over your mother's old cook stove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you crazy, Fitz, or do you want to craze me?"
cried the really <i>tried</i> woman.</p>

<p>"Turning your slap-jacks," continues Fitz, suiting the
action to the word.</p>

<p>"Fitzfaddle!" cries Mrs. Fitz, in the most sublimated
paroxysm of pity and indignation, but Fitz let it come.</p>

<p>"<i>While I dandled Nanny on my knee!</i>"</p>

<p>A pause ensues; Fitzfaddle, in contemplation of the past,
and Mrs. Fitz fortifying herself for the opening of a campaign
to come. At length, after a deal of "dicker," Fitz
remembering only the bad dinners, small rooms, large
bills, sick, parboiled state of the children, clash and clamor
of his trips to the Springs, sea-side and mountain resorts;
and Mrs. Fitz dwelling over the strong opposition (show
and extravagance) she had run against the many ambitious
shop-keepers' wives, tradesmen's, lawyers' and doctors'
daughters&mdash;Mrs. Fitz gained her point, and the family,&mdash;Mrs.
Fitz, the two now marriageable daughters&mdash;Anna
Antoinette De Orville, and Eugenia Heloise De Orville,
and Alexander Montressor De Orville, and two servants&mdash;start
in style, for the famed city of Hull!</p>

<p>It was yet early in the season, and Fitzfaddle had
secured, upon accommodating terms, rooms &amp;c., of Mrs. Fitzfaddle's
own choosing. With the diplomacy of five prime
ministers, and with all the pride, pomp and circumstance of
a fine-looking woman of two-and-forty,&mdash;husband rich, and
indulgent at that; armed with two "marriageable daughters,"
you may&mdash;if at all familiar with life at a "watering-place,"
fancy Mrs. Fitzfaddle's feelings, and perhaps, also, about
a third of the <i>swarth</i> she cut. The first evident opposition
Mrs. Fitz encountered, was from the wife of a wine merchant.
This lady made her <i>entree</i> at &mdash;&mdash; House, with a
pair of bays and "body servant," two poodles, and an immensity
of band boxes, patent leather trunks, and&mdash;her
husband. The first day Mrs. Oldport sat at table, her new
style of dress, and her European jewels, were the afternoon
talk; but at tea, the Fitzfaddles <i>spread</i>, and Mrs. Oldport
was bedimmed, easy; the next day, however, "turned up"
an artist's wife and daughter, whose unique elegance of
dress and proficiency in music took down the entire collection!
Mrs. Michael Angelo Smythe and daughter
captivated two of Mrs. Fitzfaddle's "circle"&mdash;a young
naval gent and a 'quasi Southern planter, much to her
chagrin and Fitzfaddle's pecuniary suffering; for next evening
Mrs. F. got up,&mdash;to get back her two recruits&mdash;a
grand private <i>hop</i>, at a cost of $130! And the close of
the week brought such a cloud of beauty, jewels, marriageable
daughters and ambitious mothers, wives, &amp;c., that
Mrs. Fitzfaddle got into such a worry with her diplomatic
arrangements, her competitions, stratagems,&mdash;her fuss, her
jewels, silks, satins and feathers, that a nervous-headache
preceded a typhus fever, and the unfortunate lady was
forced to retire from the field of her glory at the end of the
third week, entirely prostrated; and poor Jonas Fitzfaddle
out of pocket&mdash;more or less&mdash;<i>five hundred dollars!</i> The
last we heard of Fitzfaddle, he was apostrophizing the good
old times when he rejoiced in five old chairs&mdash;cook stove&mdash;slap-jacks, &amp;c.!</p>

<h2><a name="on_a_Platform" id="on_a_Platform"></a>Putting Me on a Platform!</h2>


<p>Human nature doubtless has a great many weak
points, and no few bipeds have a great itching after
notoriety and fame. Fame, I am credibly informed, is not
unlike a greased pig, always hard chased, but too eternal
slippery for every body to hold on to! I have never
cared a tinker's curse for glory myself; the satisfaction of
getting quietly along, while in pursuit of bread, comfort
and knowledge, has sufficed to engross my individual attention;
but I've often "had my joke" by observing the various
grand dashes made by cords of folks, from snob to nob,
patrician to plebeian, in their gyrations to form a circle,
in which they might be the centre pin! This desire,
or feeling, is a part and parcel of human nature; you will
observe it every where&mdash;among the dusky and man-eating
citizens of the Fejee Islands&mdash;the dog-eating population of
China&mdash;the beef-eaters of England, and their descendants,
ye <i>Yankoos</i> of the new world; all, all have a tendency
for lionization.</p>

<p>This very <i>innocent</i> pastime finds a great many supporters,
too; toadyism is the main prop that sustains and exalteth
the vain glory of man; if you can only get a <i>toady</i>&mdash;the
<i>more</i> the better&mdash;you can the sooner and firmer fix
your digits upon the greased pig of fame; but as thrift
must always follow fawning, or toadyism, it is most essentially
necessary that you be possessed of a greater or lesser
quantity of the goods and chattels of this world, or some
kind of tangible effects, to grease the wheels of your emollient
supporters; otherwise you will soon find all your
air-built castles, dignity and glory, dissolve into mere gas, and
your stern in the gravel immediately.</p>

<p>Such is the pursuit of glory, and such its supporters, their
gas and human weakness. I have said that I never sought
distinction, but I have had it thrust upon me more than
once, and the last effort of the kind was so particularly
<i>salubrious</i>, that I must relate to you, <i>confidentially</i> of
course, how it came about.</p>

<p>When I first came to Boston, as a matter of course, I
spent much of my time in surveying "the lions," dipping
into this, and peeping into that; promenading the Common
and climbing the stupendous stairway of Bunker Hill;
ransacking the forts, islands, beautiful Auburn, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Finally, I went into the State House, but as this notable
building was undergoing some repairs, placards were
tacked up about the doors, prohibiting persons from strolling
about the capitol. The attendant was very polite, and
told me, and several others desirous to see the building inside,
that if we called in the course of a few days, we could
be gratified, but for the present no one but those engaged
about the work, were allowed to enter. I persisted so
closely in my desire to examine the interior, while on the
spot, that the man, when the rest of the visitors had gone,
relented, and I was not only allowed to see what I should
see, but he <i>toted</i> me "round."</p>

<p>We sauntered into the Assembly Chamber, surveyed and
learned all the particulars of that, peered into the side-rooms,
closets, &amp;c., and then came to the Senate Chamber.
This you know is something finer than the country meeting
house, or circus-looking Assembly Chamber, where the
"fresh-men," or green members from Hard-Scrabble, Hull,
Squantum, etc.,&mdash;incipient Demostheneses, and sucking
Ciceros, first tap their gasometers "in the haouse." Here
I found the venerable pictures of the ancient <i>mugs</i>, who
have figured as Governors, &amp;c., of the commonwealth, from
the days of Puritan Winthrop to the ever-memorable Morton,
who, strange as it may appear, was really elected
Governor, though a double-distilled Democrat. Bucklers,
swords, drums and muskets, that doubtless rattled and
banged away upon Bunker Hill, were duly, carefully and
critically examined, and as a finale to my debut in the Senate,
I mounted the Speaker's stand, and spouted about
three feet of Webster's first oration at Bunker Hill. To
be sure, my audience was <i>small</i>, but <i>it</i> was duly attentive,
and as I waved my hands aloft, and thumped my ribs, after
the most approved system of patriotic vehemence of the
day, he&mdash;my audience&mdash;opened his mouth, and stretched his
eyes to the size of dinner plates, at my prodigious slaps at
eloquence; the very ears of the <i>canvased</i> governors seemed
pricked up, and I descended the stand big as Mogul,
insinuated "a quarter" into the palm of the polite attendant,
informed him I should call in a few days to take a view
from the top of the dome, &amp;c. He bowed and I took myself off.</p>

<p>Several days afterwards I found myself in the vicinity of
the State House; so, thinks I, I'll just drop in, and go up to
the top of the dome and get a view of the city and suburbs.</p>

<p>My chaperon was on hand, and he no sooner clapped
eyes upon me, than he pitched into all manner of highfernooten
flub-dubs, bowed and scraped, and regretted that the
day was so misty and dull, as I would not be enabled to
have half a chance to get a view.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't try it to-day, sir," said he.</p>

<p>"What's the reason?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied he, "you'll not see half the outline of the
city and the villages around, and you'll want to get them all
down distinct."</p>

<p>"Get them all <i>down</i> distinct?" quoth I.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and the day is so dull and cloudy that you'll
not see half the prominent buildings, never mind the whole
of the former and not so easily seen houses. You intend
taking a full view, don't you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I would like to," says I, partly lost to conceive
what caused such a sudden and unaccountable ebullition
of the man's great interest in my getting "a first rate
notice" of matters and things from the top of the capitol!
But up I went, in spite of my attentive friend's fears of my
not getting quite so clear and distinct a view as he could
wish. Having gratified myself with such a view as the
weather and the height of the capitol afforded (and in
clear weather you can get far the best survey of Boston
and the environs from the top of the State House than from
any other promontory about), I descended again. At the
foot of the stairway my assiduous cicerone again beset me,
introduced several other miscellaneous-looking chaps to me,
and, in short, was making of me, why or wherefore I knew
not, quite a lion!</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, "what do you think of it, sir? Could
you get the outline?"</p>

<p>"Not very well," said I, "but the view is very fine."</p>

<p>"O, yes, sir," said he; "but as soon as you wish to begin,
sir, let me know, and I'll lock the upper doors when
you go up, and you'll not be disturbed, sir."</p>

<p>"Lock the doors?" said I, in some amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," quoth he, "but it would be best to come as
early in the morning as possible, or, if convenient, before
the visitors begin to come up; they'd disturb you, you know!"</p>

<p>"Disturb <i>me!</i> Why, I don't know how they would do that?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, when Mr. Smith&mdash;you know Mr. Smith, sir,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; the name strikes me as <i>somewhat</i> familiar;
do you refer to <i>John Smith</i>?" I observed, beginning to
participate in the joke, which began to <ins title="develope">develop</ins> itself
pretty distinctly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I believe his name is John&mdash;John R. Smith;
he's a splendid artist, sir; <i>his</i> sketch or panorama is a
beauty! Sir! did you ever see his panorama?"</p>

<p>"I think I did, in New York," I replied.</p>

<p>By this time some dozen or two visitors had congregated
around us, and I was the centre of a considerable circle,
and from the whispers, and pointing of fingers, I felt duly
sensible, that, great or small, I was a <span class="smcap">lion</span>! Under what
auspices, I was in too dense a fog to make out; to me it
was an unaccountable mist'ry.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I can do, sir," continued my toady;
"I can have a small platform erected, outside of the cupola,
for you, to place your <i>designs</i> or sketches on, and you'll
not be so liable to be disturbed. Mr. Smith, he had a
platform made, sir."</p>

<p>I beckoned the man to step aside, in the Senate Chamber.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said I, "you will please inform me, who the
devil do you take me for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew who you were, the moment you came in,
sir," said he, with a very knowing leer out of his half-squinting eyes.</p>

<p>"Did you? Well then I must certainly give you credit
for devilish keen perception; but, if it's a fair question," I
continued, "what do you mean by fixing a platform for my
<i>designs</i>? You don't think I'm going to fly, jump or deliver
orations from the cupola, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't; but you're to draw a grand panorama of
Boston, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Me?</span>"</p>

<p>"Yes, you; ain't your name Mr. Banvard?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes&mdash;I understand&mdash;you've found me out, but
keep dark&mdash;mum's the word&mdash;you understand?" said I, winkingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'll fix it all right; you'll want the platform
outside, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yes; out with it, and <i>keep dark until I come!</i>"</p>

<p>I skeeted down them steps into the Common to let off
my corked up risibilities.&mdash;Whether the man actually did
prepare a platform for my designs, or whether Banvard ever
went to take his designs there, I am unable to say, as I went
South a few days afterward, and did not return for some time.</p>

<p>Few <i>extravaganzas</i> of man or woman lay such a heavy
<i>stress</i> upon the pocket-book or purse as meanness. This
may seem paradoxical, but it's nothing of the kind. How
many thousands to save a cent, walk a mile! How many to
cut down expenses, cut off a thousand of the little "filling

refused to let his little boy run an errand for Johnson, and
when Jones's house was in a blaze, Johnson forbid him
touching his water to put it out. Smith by accident ran

dislocated Smith's collar-bone; a suit at law followed, and
Peppers being a mighty spunky, as well as a powerfully
mean man, fought it out four years, and finally sunk every
cent he had in the world by the slight transaction. It is a
first-rate idea to be economical, but the man who sees and
feels, and smells and tastes, entirely through his pocket-book,
isn't worth cultivating an acquaintance with. Go
in, marry money if you can, save up some, but don't cultivate
meanness, for it never pays.</p>

<h2><a name="Down_a_Sheriff" id="Down_a_Sheriff"></a>"Taking Down" a Sheriff.</h2>


<p>Ex-honorable John Buck, once the "representative"
of a <i>district</i> out West, a lawyer originally,
and finally a gentleman at large, and Jeremy Diddler generally,
took up his quarters in Philadelphia, years ago, and
putting himself upon his dignity, he managed for a time,
<i>sans l'argent</i>, to live like a prince. Buck was what the
world would call a devilish clever fellow; he was something
of a scholar, with the smattering of a gentleman; good at
off-hand dinner table oratory, good looking, and what
never fails to take down the ladies, he wore hair enough
about his countenance to establish two Italian grand dukes.
Buck was "an awful blower," but possessed common-sense
enough not to waste his <i>gas</i>-conade&mdash;ergo, he had the merit
not to falsify to ye ancient falsifiers.</p>

<p>The Honorable Mr. Buck's <i>manner</i> of living not being
"seconded" by a corresponding manner of <i>means</i>, he very
frequently ran things in the ground, got in debt, head and
heels. The Honorable Mr. B. had patronized a dealer in
Spanish mantles, corduroys and opera vests, to the amount
of some two hundred dollars; and, very naturally, ye fabricator
of said cloth appurtenances for ye body, got mad
towards the last, and threatened "the Western member"
with a course of legal sprouts, unless he "showed cause,"
or came up and squared the yards. As Hon. John Buck
had had frequent invitations to pursue such courses, and
not being spiritually or personally inclined that way, he let
the notice slide.</p>

<p>Shears, the tailor, determined to put the Hon. John
through; so he got out a writ of the savagest kind&mdash;arson,
burglary and false pretence&mdash;and a deputy sheriff was soon
on the taps to smoke the Western member out of his boots.
Upon inquiring at the United States Hotel, where the honorable
gentleman had been wont to "put up," they found
he had vacated weeks before and gone to Yohe's Hotel.
Thither, the next day, the deputy repaired, but old Mother
Yohe&mdash;rest her soul!&mdash;informed the officer that the honorable
gentleman had stepped out one morning, in a hurry
like, and forgot to pay a small bill!</p>

<p>John was next traced to the Marshall House, where he
had left his mark and cleared for Sanderson's, where the
indefatigable tailor and his terrier of the law, pursued the
member, and learned that he had gone to Washington!</p>

<p>"Done! by Jeems!" cried Shears.</p>

<p>"Hold on," says the deputy, "hold on; he's not off;
merely a dodge to get away from this house; we'll find him. Wait!"</p>

<p>Shears did wait, so did the deputy sheriff, until other
bills, amounting to a good round sum, were lodged at the
Sheriff's office, and the very Sheriff himself took it in hand
to nab the <i>cidevant</i> M. C., and cause him to suffer a little
for his country and his friends!</p>

<p>Now, it so chanced that Sheriff F., who was a politician
of popular renown&mdash;a good, jolly fellow&mdash;knew the Hon.
Mr. Buck, having had "the pleasure of his acquaintance"
some months previous, and having been <i>floored</i> in a political
argument with the "Western member," was inclined
to be down upon him.</p>

<p>"I'll snake him, I'll engage," says Sheriff F., as he
thrust "the documents" into his pocket and proceeded to
hunt up the transgressor. Accidentally, as it were, who
should the Sheriff meet, turning a corner into the grand
<i>trottoir</i>, Chestnut street, but our gallant hero of ye ballot-box
in the rural districts, once upon a time!</p>

<p>"Ah, ha-a-a! How are ye, Sheriff?" boisterously exclaims
the Ex-M. C., as familiarly as you please.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Mr. Buck," says the Sheriff, "glad (?) to see you."</p>

<p>"Fine day, Sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Elegant, sir, <i>prime</i>," says the Sheriff.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Mr. Jigger's speech on the Clam
trade? Did you read Mr. Porkapog's speech on the widening
of Jenkins's ditch?"</p>

<p>For which general remarks on the affairs of the nation,
Sheriff F. <i>put</i> some corresponding replies, and so they proceeded
along until they approached a well-known dining
saloon, then under the supervision of a burly Englishman;
and, as it was about the time people dined, and the Sheriff
being a man that liked a fat dinner and a fine bottle, about
as well as any body, when the Hon. Mr. Buck proposed&mdash;</p>

<p>"What say you, Sheriff, to a dinner and a bottle of old
Sherry, at &mdash;&mdash;? We don't often meet (?), so let's sit
down and have a quiet talk over things."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Buck," says the Sheriff, "I would like to,
just as soon as not, but I've got a disagreeable bit of business
with you, and it would be hardly friendly to eat your
dinner before apprizing you of the fact, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! Sheriff, what is it, pray?" says the somewhat
alarmed Diddler; "nothing serious, of course?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not serious, particularly; only a <i>writ</i>, Mr. Buck;
a writ, that's all."</p>

<p>"For my arrest?"</p>

<p>"Your arrest, sir, on sight," says the Sheriff.</p>

<p>"The deuce! What's the charge!"</p>

<p>"Debt&mdash;false pretence&mdash;<i>swindling!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! that is a good one!" says the slight'y cornered
Ex-M. C.; "well, hang it, Sheriff, don't let business
spoil our digestion; come, let us dine, and then I'm
ready for execution!" says the "Western member," with
well affected gaiety.</p>

<p>Stepping into a private room, they rang the bell, and a
burly waiter appeared.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. F.," says the adroit Ex-M. C., "call for just
what you like; I leave it to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Roast ducks; what do you say, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>"Oyster sauce and lobster salad?"</p>

<p>"Good," again echoes the Ex-M. C.</p>

<p>"And a&mdash;Well, waiter, you bring some of the best side
dishes you have," says the Sheriff.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," says the waiter, disappearing to fill the order.</p>

<p>"What are you going to drink, Sheriff?" asks the honorable gent.</p>

<p>"Oh! ah, yes! Waiter, bring us a bottle of Sherry; you
take Sherry, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go Sherry."</p>

<p>The Sherry was brought, and partly discussed by the
time the dinner was spread.</p>

<p>"They keep the finest Port here you ever tasted," says
the Diddler.</p>

<p>"Do they!" he responds; "well, suppose we try it?"</p>

<p>A bottle of old Port was brought, and the two worthies
sat back and really enjoyed themselves in the saloon of the
sumptuously kept restaurant; they then drank and smoked,
until sated nature cried enough, and the Sheriff began to
think of business.</p>

<p>"Suppose we top off with a fine bottle of English ale, Sheriff!"</p>

<p>"Well, be it so; and then, Buck, we'll have to proceed
to the office."</p>

<p>"Waiter, bring me a couple of bottles of your English
ale," says the Hon. Mr. Buck.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And I'll see to the bill, Sheriff, while the waiter brings
the ale," said the Ex-M. C., leaving the room "for a moment,"
to speak to the landlord.</p>

<p>"Landlord," says the Diddler, "do you know that gentleman
with whom I've dined in 15?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," says the landlord.</p>

<p>"Well," continues Diddler, "I've no <i>particular</i> acquaintance
with him; he invited me here to dine; I suppose
he intends to pay for what he ordered, but (whispering)
<i>you had better get your money before he gets out of
that room!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! coming that are dodge, eh? I'll show him!"
said the burly landlord, making tracks for the room, from
which the Sheriff was now emerging, to look after his prisoner.</p>

<p>"There's for the ale," says the Diddler, placing half a
dollar in the waiter's hand; "I ordered that, and there's for
it." So saying, he vamosed.</p>

<p>"Say, but look here, Buck, I say, hold on; I've got a
writ, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hang the writ! Pay your bill like a gentleman, and
come along!" exclaimed the Ex-M. C., making himself <i>scarce!</i></p>

<p>It was in vain that the Sheriff stated his "authority,"
and innocence in the pecuniary affairs of the dinner, for the
waiter swore roundly that the other gentleman had paid for
all he ordered, and the landlord, who could not be convinced
to the contrary, swore that the idea was to gouge
him, which couldn't be done, and before the Sheriff got off,
he had his wallet depleted of five dollars; and he not only
lost his prisoner, but lost his temper, at the trick played
upon him by the Hon. Jeremy Diddler.</p>

<h2><a name="First_Coal_Fire" id="First_Coal_Fire"></a>Governor Mifflin's First Coal Fire.</h2>


<p>It is truly astonishing, that the inexhaustible beds&mdash;mines
of anthracite coal, lying along the Schuylkill
river and ridges, valleys and mountains, from old Berks
county to the mountains of Shamokin, were not found out
and applied to domestic uses, fully fifty years before they
were! Coal has been exhumed from the earth, and burned
in forges and grates in Europe, from time immemorial, we
think, yet we distinctly remember when a few canal boats only
were engaged in transporting from the few mines that were
open and worked along the Schuylkill&mdash;the comparatively
few tons of anthracite coal consumed in Philadelphia, <ins title="ot">not</ins>
sent away. As far back as 1820, we believe, there was but
little if any coal shipped to Philadelphia, from the Schuylkill
mines at all.</p>

<p>Our venerable friend, the still vivacious and clear-headed
Col. Davis, of Delaware, gave us, a few years ago, a rather
amusing account of the first successful attempt of a very
distinguished old gentleman, Gov. Mifflin, to ignite a pile
of stone coal. The date of the transaction, more's the
pity, has escaped us, but the facts of the case are something
after this fashion.</p>

<p>Gov. Mifflin, of Pennsylvania, lived and owned a fine
estate in Mifflin county, and in which county was discovered
from time to time, any quantity of black rock, as the
farmers commonly called the then unknown anthracite. Of
course, the old governor knew something about stone coal,
and had a slight inkling of its character. At hours of leisure,
the <ins title="governer">governor</ins> was in the habit of experimenting upon
the black rocks by subjecting them to wood fire upon his
hearths; but the hard, almost flint-like anthracite of that
region resisted, with most obdurate pertinacity, the oft-repeated
attempts of the governor to set it on fire. It
finally became a joke among the neighboring Pennsylvania
Dutch farmers, and others of the vicinity, that Gov. Mifflin
was studying out a theory to set his hills and fields on fire,
and burn out the obnoxious black rock and boulders. But,
despite the jibes and jokes of his dogmatical friends, the
old governor stuck to his experiments, and the result produced,
as most generally it does through perseverance and
practice, a new and useful fact, or principle.</p>

<p>One cold and wintry day, Gov. Mifflin was cosily perched
up in his easy-chair, before the great roaring, blazing hickory
fire, overhauling ponderous state documents, and deeply
engrossed in the affairs of the people, when his eye caught
the outline of a big black rock boulder upon the mantle-piece
before him&mdash;it was a beautiful specimen of variegated
anthracite, with all the hues of the rainbow beaming from
its lacquered angles. The governor thought "a heap" of
this specimen of the black rock, but dropping all the documents
and State papers pell-mell upon the floor, he seized
the piece of anthracite, and placing it carefully upon the
blazing cross-sticks of the fire, in the most absorbed manner
watched the operation. To his great delight the black
rock was soon red hot&mdash;he called for his servant man, a
sable son of Africa, or some down South Congo&mdash;</p>

<p>"Isaac."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah, I'se heah, sah."</p>

<p>"Isaac, run out to the carriage-house, and get a piece of
that black rock."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah, I'se gone."</p>

<p>In a twinkling the negro had obtained a huge lump of
the anthracite, and handing it over to the governor, it was
placed in a favorable position alongside of the first lump,
and the governor's eyes fairly danced polkas as he witnessed
the fact of the two pieces of black rock assuming a red hot complexion.</p>

<p>"Isaac!" again exclaimed the governor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"Run out&mdash;get another lump."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>A third lump was added to the fire; the company in the
governor's private parlor was augmented by the appearance
of the governor's lady and other portions of the family, who,
seeing Isaac lugging in the rocks, came to the conclusion
that the governor was going "clean crazy" over his experiments.
It was in vain Mrs. Mifflin and the daughters
tried to suspend the functions of the "chief magistrate,"
over the roaring fire.</p>

<p>"Go away, women; what do you know about mineralogy,
igniting anthracite? Go way; close the doors; I've got the
rocks on fire&mdash;I'll make them laugh t'other side of their
mouths, at my black rock fires!"</p>

<p>In the midst of the excitement, as the governor was perspiring
and exulting over his fiery operation, a carriage
drove up, and two gentlemen alighted, and desired an immediate
audience with Gov. Mifflin; but so deeply engaged
was the governor, that he refused the strangers an audience,
and while directing Isaac to tell the strangers that they
must "come to-morrow," and while he continued to pile on
more black rocks, brought in by Isaac, in rushed the strangers.</p>

<p>"Good day, governor; you must excuse us, but our business
admits of no delay."</p>

<p>"Can't help it, can't help you&mdash;see how it blazes, see
how it burns!" cried the abstracted or mentally and physically
absorbed governor.</p>

<p>"But, governor, the man may be hanged, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him be hanged&mdash;hurra! See how it burns; call in
the neighbors; let them see my black rock fire. I knew I'd
surprise them!"</p>

<p>"But, governor, will you please delay this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Delay? No, not for the President of the United
States. I've been trying this experiment for eight years.
I've now succeeded&mdash;see, see how it burns! Run, Isaac,
over to Dr. &mdash;&mdash;'s, tell him to come, stop in at Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;'s,
tell Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; to come, come everybody&mdash;I've got the
black rocks in a blaze!" And clapping on his hat, out ran
the governor through the storm, down to the village, like a
madman, leaving the strangers and part of his household as
spectators of his fiery experiments. Just as the governor
cleared his own door, a pedler wagon "drove up," and
the pedler, seeing the governor starting out in such double
quick time, hailed him.</p>

<p>"Hel-lo! Sa-a-a-y, yeou heold on&mdash;<i>yeou the guv'ner</i>?"</p>

<p>"Clear out!" roared the chief magistrate.</p>

<p>"Shain't deu nothin' of the sort, no how!" says the
pedler, dismounting from his wagon, and making his appearance
at the front door, where he encountered the two
rather astonished strangers&mdash;legal gentlemen of some eminence,
from Harrisburg, with a petition for the respite of execution.</p>

<p>"Halloo! which o' yeou be the guv'ner?" says the pedler.</p>

<p>"Neither of us," replied the gentlemen; "that was the
governor you spoke to as you drove up."</p>

<p>"Yeou dun't say so! Wall, he was pesky mad about
som'-thin'. What on airth ails the ole feller?"</p>

<p>"Can't say," was the response; "but here he comes again."</p>

<p>"Now, now come in, come in and see for yourselves,"
cried the excited Governor of the great Key Stone State;
"there's a roaring fire of burning, blazing, black rock,
anthracite coal!"</p>

<p>But, alas! the cross sticks having given away in the interim,
and the coal being thrown down upon the ashes and
stone hearth,&mdash;<i>was all out!</i></p>

<p>"Wall," says our migratory Yankee, who followed the
crowd into the house, "I guess I know what yeou be at,
guv'ner, but I'll tell yeou naow, yeou can't begin to keep
that darn'd hard stuff burning, 'less yeou fix it up in a grate,
like, gin it air, and an almighty draught; yeou see, guv'ner,
I've been making experiments a darn'd long while
with it!"</p>

<p>The laugh of the governor's friends subsided as the pedler
went into a practical theory on burning stone coal; the
<i>respite</i> was signed&mdash;hospitalities of the mansion extended
to all present, and in course of a few days, our Yankee and
the governor rigged up a grate, and soon settled the question&mdash;will
our black rocks burn?</p>

<h2><a name="a_Fugitive_Subscriber" id="a_Fugitive_Subscriber"></a>Chasing a Fugitive Subscriber.</h2>


<p>Printers, from time immemorial&mdash;back possibly to
the days of Faust&mdash;have suffered martyrdom, more or
less, at the hands of the people who didn't pay! Many of
the long-established newspaper concerns can show a "black
list" as long as the militia law, and an unpaid <i>cash account</i>
bulky enough to take Cuba! Country publishers suffer in
this way intensely. About one half of the "subscribers"
to the <i>Clarion of Freedom</i>, or the <i>Universal Democrat</i>, or
the <i>Whig Shot Tower</i>, seem to labor under the Utopian
notion that printers were made to mourn over unpaid subscription
lists; or that they "got up" papers for their own
peculiar amusement, and carried them or sent them to the
doors of the public for mere pastime! Every publisher, of
about every paper we ever examined, about this time of year,
has told his own story&mdash;requested his subscribers to come
forward&mdash;pay over&mdash;help to keep the mill going&mdash;creditors
easy&mdash;fire in the stove&mdash;meal in the barrel&mdash;children in
bread, butter and shoes&mdash;Sheriff at bay, and other tragical
affairs connected with the operations attendant upon unsettled
cash accounts! But, how many heed such "notices?"
Paying subscribers do not read them&mdash;such applications do
not apply to them&mdash;<i>they</i> regret to see them in the paper,
and, like honest, common-sensed people, don't probe or
meddle with other people's shortcomings. The delinquent
subscriber don't read such <i>calls</i> upon his humanity&mdash;they
are distasteful to him; he may squint and grin over the
<i>notice</i> to pay up, and chuckles to himself&mdash;"Ah, umph!
dun away, old feller; I ain't one o' that kind that sends
money by mail; it might be lost, and the man that duns <i>me</i>
for two or three dollars' worth of newspapers, <i>may get it if
he knows how</i>."</p>

<p>Well, the good time has <i>come</i>. Printers now may wait
no longer; the jig's up&mdash;they have found out a <i>way</i> to get
their money just as easy as other laborers in the fields of
science, art, mechanism, law, physic and religion, get theirs.
Let the printer cry <i>Eureka</i>.</p>

<p>Doctor Pendleton St. Clair Smith, a patron of the fine
arts, best tailors, barbers, boot blacks, and the newspaper
press, was a tooth operator of some skill and great pretension.
He lived and moved in modern style, and though no
man could be more desirous of indulging in "short credit,"
no man believed or acted more readily upon the principle&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"base is the slave that <i>pays</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. P. St. C. Smith "slipped up" one day, leaving the
<i>well done</i> community of Boston and the environs, for
fields more congenial to his peculiar talents. He <i>stuck</i> the
printer, of course. His numerous subscription accounts
to the various local news and literary journals, in the
aggregate amounted to quite considerable; and the printers
didn't begin to like it! Now, it takes a Yankee to
head off a Yankee, and about this time a live, double-grand-action
Yankee, named Peabody, possibly, happened in at
one of the offices, where two brother publishers were "making
a few remarks" over delinquent subscribers, and especially
were they wrought up against and giving jessy to
Dr. Pendleton St. Clair Smith!</p>

<p>"How much does the feller owe you?" quoth Peabody.</p>

<p>"Owe? More than he'll ever pay during the present generation."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," says Peabody; "now if you'll just give
me the full particulars of the man, his manners and customs,
name and size, and sell me your accounts, at a low notch,
I'll buy 'em; I'll collect 'em, too, if the feller's alive, out of
jail, and any where around between sunrise and sunset!"</p>

<p>The publishers laughed at the idea, sensibly, but finding
that Peabody was up for a trade, they traced out the accounts,
&amp;c., and for a five dollar bill, Mr. Peabody was put
in possession of an account of some twenty odd dollars and
cents against Dr. P. St. C. Smith.</p>

<p>Now Peabody had, some time previous to this transaction,
established a peculiar kind of Telegraph, a human galvanic
battery, or endless chain of them, extending all over the
country, for collecting bad debts, and <i>shocking</i> fugitives,
or stubborn creditors! By a continuation of faculties,
causes and effects&mdash;shrewdness and forethought peculiar to
a man capable of seeing considerably deep into millstones&mdash;Peabody
couldn't be <i>dodged</i>. If he ever got his <i>feelers</i> on
to a subject, the <i>equivalent</i> was bound to be turning up!
It struck him that the collection of newspaper bills afforded
him a great field for working his Telegraph, and he hasn't
been mistaken.</p>

<p>The scene now changes; early one morning in the pleasant
month of June, as the poet might say, Dr. Pendleton
St. Clair Smith was to be seen before his toilet glass in
the flourishing city of Syracuse,&mdash;giving the finishing stroke
to his highly-cultivated beard. The satisfaction with which
he made this demonstration, evinced the sereneness of his
mind and the <i>confidence</i> with which he rested, in regard to
his newspaper 'bills in Boston. But a <i>tap</i> is heard at his
door, and at his invitation the servant comes in, announces
a gentleman in the parlor, desirous of speaking to Dr. Smith.
The Doctor waits upon the visitor&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dr. Pendleton St. Clair Smith, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-s," slowly and suspiciously responded that individual.</p>

<p>"I am collector, sir," continued the stranger, "for the
firm of Peabody, Grab, Catchem, and Co., Boston. I have
a small (!) bill against you, sir, to collect."</p>

<p>"What for?" eagerly quoth the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Newspaper subscriptions and advertising, sir!"</p>

<p>"I a&mdash;I a, you a&mdash;well, you call in this evening," says
the Doctor, tremulously fumbling in his pockets&mdash;"I'll
settle with you; good morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," says the collector,&mdash;"I'll call."</p>

<p>That afternoon, Dr. Pendleton St. Clair Smith vamosed!
He had barely got located in Syracuse, before they had
traced him; if he paid the printer, a cloud of other debts
would follow, and so he up stakes and made a fresh <i>dive!</i></p>

<p>"Now," says Dr. P. St. C. Smith, as he dumped himself
and baggage down in the beautiful city of Chicago, "Now
I'll be out of the range of the duns; they won't get sight
or hearing of me, for a while, I'll bet a hat!"</p>

<p>But, alas! for the delusion; the very next morning, a very
suspicious, hatchet-faced individual, made himself known as
the deputed collector of certain newspaper accounts, forwarded
from Boston, by Peabody, Grab, Catchem, &amp; Co.
The Dr. uttered a very severe <i>anathema</i>; he looked quite
streaked, he faltered; he then desired the collector to call
in course of the day, and the bill would be attended to.
The collector hoped it would be attended to, and left; so
did Dr. P. St. C. Smith <i>in the next mail line</i>.</p>

<p>About one month after the affair in Chicago, Dr. P. St.
C. Smith was seen strutting around in Charters st., New
Orleans, confident in his security, smiling in the brightness
of the scenes around him; he had just negotiated for an
office, had already concocted his advertisements, and subscribed
for the papers, when lo! the same due bill from
Boston appeared to him, in the hand of an <i>agent</i> of Peabody,
Grab, Catchem &amp; Co. The Dr. was almost tempted
to pay the bill! But, then, perhaps the <i>agent</i> had a hat full
of others&mdash;from the same place&mdash;for larger amounts!
The next day the Doctor <i>put</i> for Texas! planting himself
in the pleasant town of Bexar, and cursing duns from the
bottom of his heart&mdash;he determined to keep clear of them,
even if he had to bury himself away out here in Texas.
But what was his horror to find, the first week of his hanging
up in Bexar, that an agent of the firm of Peabody, Grab,
Catchem &amp; Co., <i>was there!</i> The Doctor <i>stepped</i> to Galveston;
on the way he accidentally <i>met</i> a travelling agent of
Peabody, Grab, Catchem &amp; Co. The Doctor took the
<i>Sabine</i> slide for Tampico; there he found the "black vomit."
He up and off again, for Mobile; his nervous system was
much worked up and his pocket-book sadly depleted!
There were two alternatives&mdash;change his name, size and
profession, and live in a swamp; <i>or settle with the firm of
Peabody, Grab, Catchem &amp; Co</i>. Dr. Pendleton St. Clair
Smith chose the latter; he sought and soon found in Mobile,
a veritable <i>agent</i>, duly authorized to receive and forward
funds for Peabody, Grab, Catchem &amp; Co., and hunt up and
down&mdash;fugitives from the printer! The Doctor paid up&mdash;felt
better, and learned the moral fact that delinquent subscribers
are no longer to be the printers' ghosts.</p>

<p>"I dunno where I heer'd it, but I know it's true. I
expected it long ago. I told Jones it'd come out so."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Josh, you don't pretend to say that Miller's
wife has run off with Bob Tape, Yardstick's clark, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, too; hain't it been the talk of the neighborhood
for a year past, that Miller's wife and that feller&mdash;Bob
Tape, were a leetle too thick?"</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Josh," says his neighbor Brown, "I don't
recollect anybody saying anything about it, but you, and
for my part, I don't believe a word of it."</p>

<p>"Why, hain't Miller's wife gone?" says Uncle Josh.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;is she?" says Brown.</p>

<p>"Be sure she is; I went over to the store this morning,
the fust thing, to see if Bob Tape was about&mdash;he wasn't
there&mdash;they said he'd gone to Boston on business for old
Yardstick. O, ho! says I, and then I started for Heeltap's
shop; we had allers said how things would turn out.
He was out, but seein' me go to his shop, he came a runnin',
and says he:</p>

<p>"'Uncle Josh, theer gone, sure enough!&mdash;I've been over
to old Mammy Gabbles, and she sent her Suke over to
Miller's, on purtence of borrowin' some lard, but told Suke
to look around and see ef Miller's wife wur about; by
Nebbyknezer, Miller's wife wur gone! Marm Gabbles
couldn't rest, so she sent back Suke, and told her to ax the
children whare their marm wus; Miller hearing Suke, ordered
her to scoot, so Suke left without hearing the facts
in the case, as 'Squire Black says.'</p>

<p>"But Heeltap swears, and I know Miller's wife and Bob
Tape have <i>sloped</i>, as they say in the papers."</p>

<p>"Well," says Brown, "I'm sorry if it's true&mdash;I don't believe
a word of it tho', and as it's none of my business, I
shall have nothing to say about it."</p>

<p>Uncle Josh was one of those inordinate pests which almost
every village, town and hamlet in the country is more
or less accursed with. He was a great, tall, bony, sharp-nosed,
grinning <i>genius</i>, who, being in possession of a small
farm, with plenty of boys and girls to work it, did not do
anything but eat, sleep and lounge around; a gatherer of
<i>scan, mag</i>., a news and scandal-monger, a great guesser, and
a stronger suspicioner, of everybody's motives and intentions,
and, of course, never imputed a good motive or movement
to anybody.</p>

<p>You've seen those wretches, male and female, haven't
you, reader? Such people are great nuisances&mdash;half the
discomforts of life are bred by them; they contaminate and
poison the air they breathe, with their noisome breath, like
the odor of the Upas tree.</p>

<p>Uncle Josh had annoyed many&mdash;he was the dread and
disgust of seven-eighths of the town he lived in. He had
caused more quarrels, smutted more characters, and created
more ill-feeling between friends, neighbors and acquaintances,
than all else beside in the community of Frogtown.
Uncle Josh was voted a great bore by the men, and a
sneaking, meddling old granny by the women. So, at last,
the young women of the town did agree, that the very next
time Uncle Josh carried, concocted, or circulated any slanderous
or otherwise mischievous stories, <i>they would duck
him in the mill-race</i>.</p>

<p>Now, Brown&mdash;old Mister Brown&mdash;was the very antipode
of Uncle Josh; he was for always taking matters and
things by the smoothest handle. Mister Brown never told
tales, backbited or slandered anybody; everybody had a
good word to say about Mister Brown, and Mister Brown
had a good word to say about everybody. The gals thought
it prudent to give old Mister Brown an inkling of their
plans in regard to the disposition they intended to make of
Uncle Josh; the old man laughed, and told them to go
ahead, and to duck old Josh, and perhaps they would reform him.</p>

<p>"Now, gals," says old Mister Brown, "Uncle Josh has
just this very day been at his dirty work; by this time he
has spread the news all over the town, that Miller's wife
has gone off with Yardstick's clark. I don't believe a word
of his tale, and if Miller's wife ain't really gone off, Uncle
Josh ought to be soused in the mill-race."</p>

<p>Next morning Miller's wife came home; she had been
down to her sister's, a few miles off, to see a sick child; her
husband had been away at a law-suit, in a neighboring
town, and so Miller nor his wife knew nothing of the report
of her elopement with Bob Tape, until their return.</p>

<p>Miller was in a rage, but couldn't find out the author of
the report. Miller's wife was deeply mortified that such a
suspicion should arise of her; she had been making Bob
Tape some new clothes to go to Boston in, and here was
the gist of Bob and Miller's wife's intimacy! There was
a great time about it&mdash;Miller swore like a trooper, and his
wife nearly cried her eyes out.</p>

<p>A few evenings afterwards, it being cool, clear weather in
October, Polly Higgins and Sally Smith called in to see
Miller's wife, and asked her to join them in a little party
that some of the neighboring women had got up that evening,
for a particular purpose. Miller's wife not having
much to do that evening, her husband said she might go
out a spell if she chose, and she went, and soon learned the
purport of the call&mdash;old Uncle Josh was to be ducked in
the mill-race! and Miller's wife, disguised as the rest, was
to help do it. When she heard that old Josh had
circulated the report of her elopement, Miller's wife did not
require much coaxing to join the watering committee.</p>

<p>It was so planned that all the women, some ten or twelve
in number, were to put on men's clothes and lay in wait for
Uncle Josh at his lane gate, about a quarter of a mile from
the mill-race. Old Josh always hung around the tavern,
Heeltap's shoe-shop, or the grocery, until 9 P. M., before
he started for home, and the girls determined to rush out
of a small thicket that stood close by old Josh's lane gate,
and throwing a large, stout sheet over him, wind him up,
and then seizing him head, neck and heels, hurry him off to
the mill-race, and duck him well.</p>

<p>Mind you, your country gals and women are not paint
and powder, corset-laced and fragile creatures, like your
delicate, more ornamental than useful young ladies of the
city; no, no, the gals of Frogtown were real flesh and
blood; Venuses and Dianas of solidity and substance;
and it would have taken several better men than Uncle
Josh to have got away from them. It was a cool, moon-shiny
night, but to better favor the women, just as old
Josh got near his gate, a large, black cloud obscured the
moon, and all was as dark as a stack of black cats in a coal
cellar. Miller's wife acted as captain; dressed in Bob
Tape's old clothes he had left at her house to be repaired,
she gave the word, and out they rushed.</p>

<p>"Seize him, boys!" said she, in a very loud whisper.
Over went the sheet, down came old Josh, co-blim! Before
he could say "lor' a massy," he was dragged to the
mill-race, tied hand and foot, blindfolded, his coat taken off,
and he was <i>ca-soused</i> into the cold water! Fury! how the
old fellow begged for his life!</p>

<p>"O, lor' a massy, don't drown me boys! I&mdash;a, I&mdash;" <i>ca-souse</i>
he went again.</p>

<p>"Give him another duck," says one&mdash;and in he'd go again.</p>

<p>"Now, we'll learn you to carry tales," says another.</p>

<p>"And tell lies on me and Miller's wife," says Bob Tape&mdash;ca-souse
he went.</p>

<p>"O, lor' a mas&mdash;mas&mdash;e, do&mdash;do&mdash;don't drown me, Bob;
I'll&mdash;I'll promise never to&mdash;" in they put him again; the
water was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>"Will you promise never to take or carry a story again?"</p>

<p>"I d&mdash;d&mdash;d&mdash;<i>do</i> promise, if&mdash;yo&mdash;yo&mdash;yo&mdash;you&mdash;don't&mdash;duc&mdash;"
and in he went again.</p>

<p>"Do you promise to mind your own business and let
others alone, Uncle Josh?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, I d&mdash;<i>do</i>, I&mdash;I&mdash;I'll promise anything&mdash;bo&mdash;boys,
only let me go," says Uncle Josh.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," says Polly Higgins, rousing, jolly critter
she was, too, "I owe Uncle Josh one more dip: he lied
about my gal, Polly Higgins, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, ho, Seth Jones, that's you, ain't it?&mdash;Well&mdash;we&mdash;well,
I said nothing about Polly; it was Heeltap said it,
'deed it was."</p>

<p>Then they let old Josh off, vowing they'd give Heeltap
his gruel next night, and the moment Josh got clear of
his sousers, he cut for home. Next day Heeltap cleared
himself.&mdash;Uncle Josh soon found out that he had been
ducked by the women, and, for his own peace, moved
to Iowa, and Frogtown has been a happy place ever since.</p>

<h2><a name="your_own_Wife" id="your_own_Wife"></a>Penalty of Kissing your own Wife.</h2>


<p>Cato, when Censor of Rome, expelled from the Senate
Manilius, whom the general opinion had marked out
for counsellor, because he had given his wife a kiss in the
day time, in the sight of his daughter. And this reminds
us of a local story told us by one of the "oldest inhabitants"
of the city, that occurred once upon a time in this
harbor. Before the Revolutionary war, one of the King's
ships was stationed here, and occasionally cruised down to
the south'ard. It so chanced that after a long absence the
cruiser arrived in the harbor on Sunday, and as the naval
captain had left his wife in Boston, the moment she heard
of his arrival she hastened down to the water side in order
to receive him. The worthy old sea captain, on landing,
embraced his lady with tenderness and true affection.
This, as there were many spectators by, gave great offence
to the puritanical landsmen, and was considered as an act
of indecency and a flagrant profanation of the Sabbath.
The next day, therefore, the captain was summoned before
the magistrates and selectmen, who, with many severe rebukes
and pious exhortations, ordered him to be publicly whipped!</p>

<p>The old captain stifled his indignation and resentment as
much as possible; and as the punishment, from the frequency
of it, was not attended with any degree of disgrace,
he mixed as usual with the best of company, and even with
the selectmen he soon ceased to be else than familiar as ever.</p>

<p>At length the vessel was ordered home, to England, and
the captain, therefore, with seeming concern to take leave
of his worthy friends, and that they might spend a more
happy and convivial day together before their final separation,
invited the principal magistrates and selectmen to
dine with him the day of his departure, on board his ship.
They readily accepted the invitation, and nothing could be
more glorious than the entertainment that was given.</p>

<p>At length the solemn moment arrived that was to part
them&mdash;the anchor was apeak, the sails unfurled, and nothing
was wanted but the signal to get under way. The
captain, after taking an affectionate and formal leave of
his worthy municipal friends, accompanied them upon deck
where the boatswain and crew were ready to receive them.
He here thanked them afresh for the civilities they had
shown him, of which the captain assured them he should
bear a kind remembrance.</p>

<p>"One point of civility, only," he continued, "gentlemen,
remains to be adjusted between us, and as it is in my
power to settle it, I shall be most happy to do so. You
infernal old rogues you, you whipped me for evincing a
due regard and love for my wife, and now, lest you perpetrate
the outrage again 'gainst all law and reason, I'll
give you a lesson that will last your lifetime. Boatswain,
strip each of these rogues to the waist, lash them fast and
put on your cat-o'-nine tails forty stripes each!"</p>

<p>The boatswain, mid the laugh and acclamation of the
whole crew, went to the work with a hearty good will, and
after giving the magistrates and selectmen a fine dressing
all around, he cut them loose, put them in their boat, and
the ship set sail down the harbor and soon disappeared in
the dim dist cut ocean.</p>

<h2><a name="Miseries_of_Housekeeping" id="Miseries_of_Housekeeping"></a>Mysteries and Miseries of Housekeeping.</h2>


<p>People of experience tell awful stories about the
miseries of boarding, and boarding-houses, and it is
very clearly palpable to us that keepers of boarding-houses
could a tale unfold of their own miseries, equal, if not
double that of the luckless creatures who board. That
housekeeping has its joys it would be vain to deny, but
we need no ghost come from the grave to inform us that
the secrets of the kitchen are as numerous and as harrowing,
as all can attest that ever had occasion to keep house
or hire a "Betty."</p>

<p>When Mr. Peter Perriwinkle got married, he exclaimed
against hotels, and abominated boarding-houses; quitting
both species of human habitations, he "up" and rented a
house, and to hear his glowing description of the house&mdash;such
a cosy little three-storied brick house, on a street too
broad for the neighbors opposite to see into his front parlors,
and no houses in the rear from which the prying eye
of the curious and idle could spy into back kitchen closets
or dinner pots&mdash;in brief, Perriwinkle went on with that
strain of domestic eloquence, peculiar to new beginners in
the arts and mysteries of housekeeping, and after a general
detail of the quiet comfort and unalloyed happiness he
and Mrs. P. were bound to enjoy for the balance of their
lives, we merely observed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear sir, you've but the ephemeral bright side
of your vision yet. But no matter, dear Pete, as the man
said of the sausages&mdash;hope for the best, but be prepared
for the worst."</p>

<p>"But, brother Jack, I've no reason to look for any thing
but a good time. Haven't I married one of the best women
in the world? I'm too experienced in life, my boy, to call
any female women angels, doves, or sugar plums, you know,
but my wife is a real woman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Pete, she is all that," said we.</p>

<p>"Well, ain't I square with the world? Enough laid up
for a wet day&mdash;don't care twopence ha'penny for politics,
or soldier fol-de-rols&mdash;who wins or who loses in such hums?"</p>

<p>"Granted, old fellow."</p>

<p>"I tell you I've a perfect little paradise of a house engaged,
furnished and provisioned for a twelvemonth."</p>

<p>"No doubt of all that."</p>

<p>"As to friends and acquaintances, I have plenty, and
of the right stripe, too; I'd swear to that without any reluctance."</p>

<p>"I hope, Peter, you have."</p>

<p>"Then what in faith do you imagine I have in embryo to
upset or disturb the even tenor of my way, old boy? Come,
answer that."</p>

<p>"Does your domestic apparatus work well?"</p>

<p>"I haven't tried it yet."</p>

<p>"Are your appurtenances&mdash;your household appointments&mdash;from
kitchen to parlor, from coal cellar to top scuttle, all
they are cracked up to be?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, the fact is, I can't tell that, yet."</p>

<p>"Do your chimneys draw? Does your range or cooking
stove do things up brown? Have you got your Bettys?"</p>

<p>"I vow you've sort of got me this time, brother Jack;
but I'll find out, soon, and let you know."</p>

<p>"Do, if you please, Peter, and let us hear an account
of how things are working after the first quarter's experience."</p>

<p>Perriwinkle opened with a neat supper party. We attended,
and every thing looked cap-a-pie; new, tasteful and
happy as any thing human under God's providence and the
art and judgment of man could promise. At midnight the
company dispersed, all wishing the Perriwinkles life, love,
and lots of the small fry.</p>

<p>Months passed, full three; we met our old and familiar
friend, Peter Perriwinkle, and as we had not seen him for
some time, we met with greetings most cordial.</p>

<p>"How is every thing, old boy&mdash;paradise regained?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Peter, with an ominous shake of the head,
"dear Jack,&mdash;we've a great deal to learn in this world,
and as our old friend Sam Veller says, whether its worth
while to pay so much to learn so little, at cost&mdash;is a question."</p>

<p>"You begin to think so, eh?"</p>

<p>"Things don't work quite so smooth as I expected&mdash;I've moved!"</p>

<p>"What? Not so soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Perriwinkle; "that house was a nuisance!"</p>

<p>"A nuisance? Why, I thought you were in raptures with it?"</p>

<p>"Had water every wet spell, knee-deep in the cellar; full
of rats, bugs, and foul air."</p>

<p>"You don't say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Perriwinkle, mournfully. "Chimneys
smoked, paper peeled off the walls, Mrs. P. got the rheumatics,
a turner worked all night, next door, the fellow that
had previously lived or stayed in the house, ran off, leaving
all his bills unpaid, and our door bell was incessantly kept
ringing by ugly and impudent duns, and the creditors of
the rascal, whom I did not know from a side of sole leather.
I lived there in purgatory!"</p>

<p>"Too bad," said we. "Well, you've moved, eh?"</p>

<p>"Moved&mdash;and such an infernal job as it was. You know
the two vases I received as a present from my brother, at
Leghorn; I wouldn't have taken $100 each, for them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are worth it; more too."</p>

<p>"The carman dropped one out of his hands, broke it into
a half bushel of flinders, and I hit the centre table upon
which the other stood, with a chair, and broke it into forty
pieces. But, that wasn't any thing, sir. My wife packed
up the elegant set of china presented her by her sister, in a
large clothes basket, and set it out in the hall, and while
our Irish girl and the carman were carrying out a heavy
trunk, the girl lost her balance and fell bump into the basket.
She weighed over two hundred pounds&mdash;every article
of the china was crushed into powder!"</p>

<p>"This was too bad," said we, condolingly.</p>

<p>"Our carpets were torn in getting them up, for I had
them put down fast and tight, never supposing they'd come
up until thread-bare and out of fashion; they were stained
and daubed. The veneering of the piano and other furniture
is scratched and torn; a hundred small matters are
mutilated. Franklin thought a few moves was as bad as a
fire; one move convinces me that the old man was right.
But, my dear fellow, I won't bore you with my miseries.
We are now moved, and look comfortable again. Call and
see us, do. Good bye."</p>

<p>About a fortnight after meeting Perriwinkle, one evening
we went up town to see him and his lady. Mrs. P.,
before marriage, was an uncommon even-tempered and
most amiable woman. She had now been married about six
months. Upon entering the parlor we found Mrs. P.
laboring under much "excitement," and poor Peter&mdash;he
was doing his best to pacify and soothe her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halloo! what's the trouble?"&mdash;we were familiar enough
to ask the question&mdash;as they were alone, without intruding.</p>

<p>"Take a seat, John," said Perriwinkle. "Mrs. P. and
the cook have had a misunderstanding. A little muss,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Mr. Humphries," responded the irritated wife, "you
don't know how one's temper and good nature are put out,
sir, by housekeeping; by the impudence, awkwardness, and
wasteful habits of servants, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, we do, Mrs. P.; we've had our experience," we replied.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she continued, "I have suffered so in ordering,
directing, and watching these women and girls&mdash;had
my feelings so outraged by them, time and again, since we
began housekeeping, that I vow I am out of all manner of
patience and charity for them. We have had occasion to
change our help so often, that I finally concluded to submit
to the awkwardness that cost us sets of china, dozens of
glasses, stained carpets, soiled paints, smeared walls, rugs
upon the top of the piano, and the piano cloths put down
for rugs; Mr. P.'s best linen used for mops, and puddings
boiled in night-caps. But, sir, when this evening I found
the dough-tray filled with the chambermaid's old clothes,
she wiping the lamps with our linen napkins, and the cook
washing out her stockings in the dinner pot&mdash;I gave way
to my angry passions, and cried with vexation!"</p>

<p>And she really did cry, for female blood of Mrs. P.'s
pilgrim stock, couldn't stand that, nohow.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Perriwinkle and lady sold off, and took rooms
at the Tremont House, in order to preserve their morals
and money.</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="of_a_Dandy" id="of_a_Dandy"></a>Miseries of a Dandy.</h2>


<p>That <ins title="poverity">poverty</ins> is at times very unhandy&mdash;yea, humiliating,
we can bear witness; but that any persons
should make their poverty an everlasting subject of shame
and annoyance to themselves, is the most contemptible nonsense
we know of. During our junior days, while officiating
as "shop boy," behind a counter in a southern city, we
used to derive some fun from the man&oelig;uvres of a dandy-jack
of a fellow in the same establishment. He was of the bullet-headed,
pimpled and stubby-haired <i>genus</i>, but dressed
up to the <i>nines</i>; and had as much pride as two half-Spanish
counts or a peacock in a barnyard.</p>

<p>Charley was mostly engaged in the ware rooms, laboratory,
etc., up stairs. He would arrive about 7 A. M.,
arrayed in the costume of <i>the latest style</i>, as he flaunted
down Chestnut Street&mdash;by the way, it was a long, idle
tramp, out of his road to do so,&mdash;his hair all frizzled up,
hat shining and bright as a May morn, his dickey so stiff
he could hardly expectorate over his <i>goatee</i>, while his
"stunnin'" scarf and dashing pin stuck out to the admiration
of Charley's extensive eyes, and the astonishment of half
the clerks and all the shop boys along the line of our Beau
Brummell's promenade!</p>

<p>It was very natural to conceive that Charley was impressed
with the idea, that he was the envy of half the men,
and the <i>beau</i> ideal of all the women he met! But your
real dandy is no particular lover of women; he very naturally
so loves himself that he lavishes all his fond affection
upon his own person. So it was with our <i>beau</i>&mdash;he
wouldn't have risked dirtying his hands, soiling his "patent
leathers," or disarranging his scarf the thirteenth of an
inch, to save a lady from a mad bull, or being run down
by a wheelbarrow! Charley, to be sure, would walk with
them, talk with them, beau them to the theatre, concert or
ball room, provided always&mdash;they were dressed all but to
within half an inch of their lives! The man who introduced
a new and <i>stunnin</i>' hat, scarf, or coat, Charley would swear
friendship to, on sight! A shabby, genteel person was his
abomination; a patch or darn, utterly horrifying! He
lived, moved, breathed&mdash;ideally, his ideality based, of course,
upon ridiculous superfluities of life&mdash;leather and prunella,
entirely. Charley looked upon "a dirty day" as upon a
villanously-dressed person, while a bright, shining morn&mdash;giving
him amplitude to make a "grand dash," won from
him the same encomiums to the producer that he would
bestow on the getter-up of an elegant pair of cassimeres&mdash;commendable
works of an artist! The <i>genus</i> dandy,
whether of savage or civilized life, is a felicitous subject for
peculiar, speculative, comparative analogy or <i>analysis</i>; we
shall pursue the shadow no farther, but come to the substance.</p>

<p>After arriving at the establishment, Charley would strip
off his "top hamper," placing his finery in a closet with
the care and diligence of a maiden of thirty, and upwards.
Then, donning a rude pair of over-alls and coat, he condescended
to go to work. Now, in the said establishment,
our <i>beau</i> had few friends; the men, girls, and boys were
"down" upon him; the men, because of his dandyism; the
females hated him, because Charley stuck his long nose <i>up</i>
at "shop girls," and wouldn't no more notice them in the
streets, than if they were chimney sweepers or decayed
esculents! We boys didn't like him no how, generally,
though it was policy for him to treat us tolerably decent,
because his pride made it imperiously necessary that some
of the "little breeches" should do small chores, errands,
bringing water from the street, carrying down to <i>the shop</i>
goods, etc., which might otherwise devolve upon himself.
But men, girls and boys were always scheming and practising
jokes and tricks upon the <i>beau</i>. The boys would all
rush off to dinner&mdash;first having so dirtied the water, hid
the towels and soap, that poor Charley would necessarily
be obliged to go down into the public street and bring up
a bucket of the clean element to wash his begrimed face
and hands. And mark the difficulties and <i>diplomacy</i> of
such an arrangement. Charley would slip down into the
lower entry, peep out to see if any body was looking,&mdash;if a
genteel person was visible, the <i>beau</i> held back with his
bucket; after various <ins title="reconnoissances">reconnaissances</ins>, the coast would
appear clear, and the <i>beau</i> would dash out to the pump,
agitate "the iron-tailed cow" with the force and speed of
an infantile earthquake&mdash;snatch up the bucket, and with
one <i>dart</i> hit the doorway, and glide up stairs, thanking his
stars that nobody "seen him do it!"</p>

<p>In one of these <i>forays</i> for water, the <i>beau</i> was decidedly
cornered by two of the "shop girls." They, sly creatures,
observed poor Charley from an upper "landing" of the
stairway, in the entry below, watching his chance to get a
clear coast to fill his dirty bucket. The moment the beau
darted out, down rush the girls&mdash;slam to the door and
bar it!</p>

<p>The <i>beau</i>, dreaming of no such diabolical inventions,
gives the pump an awful <i>surge</i>, fills the bucket, looks down
the street, and&mdash;O! murder, there come two ladies&mdash;the
first <i>cuts</i> of the city, to whom Charley had once the honor
of a personal introduction! With his face turned over his
shoulder at the <i>ladies</i>&mdash;his nether limbs desperately nerved
for <i>tall walking</i>,&mdash;he dashes at the supposed open entryway,
and&mdash;nearly knocked the panel out of the door, smashing
the bucket, spilling the water, and slightly killing himself!</p>

<p>It was almost "a cruel joke," in the girls, who, taking
advantage of the stunning effect of the operation, unbarred
the door and vanished, before poor Charley picked himself
up and scrambled into the lower store to recuperate.</p>

<p>Weeks ran on; the beau had enjoyed a respite from the
wiles of his persecutors, when one morning he was forced
to come down into the store in his working gear, well be-spattered
with oleaginous substances, dust and dirt; in this
gear, Charley presented about as ugly and primitive a looking
Christian, as might not often&mdash;before California life
was dreamed of&mdash;be seen in a city. We <i>did</i> quite an extensive
retail trade&mdash;the store was rarely free from <i>ton</i>-ish
citizens, mostly "fine ladies," in quest of fine perfumes,
soaps, oils, etc., to sweeten and decorate their own beautiful
selves. But, before venturing in, our <i>beau</i> had an eye
about the horizon, to see that no impediments offered;
things looked safe, and in comes the beau.</p>

<p>We were upon very fair terms with Charley, and he was
wont to regale us with many of his long stories about the
company he <i>faced</i> into, the "conquests" he made, and the
times he had with this and that, in high life. Fanny Kemble
was about that time&mdash;belle of the season! <i>Lioness</i> of the
day! setting corduroy in a high fever, and raising an awful
<i>furore</i>&mdash;generally! Alas! how soon such things&mdash;cave in!</p>

<p>Charley got behind the counter to stow away some articles
he had brought down, and began one of his usual harangues:</p>

<p>"Theatre, last night, Jack?"</p>

<p>"No; couldn't get off; wanted to," said we.</p>

<p>"O, you missed a grand opportunity to see the fashion
beauty and wealthy people of this city! Such a house!
Crowded from pit to dome, met a hundred and fifty of my
friends&mdash;ladies of the first families in town, with all the
'high boys' of my acquaintance!"</p>

<p>"And how did Fanny <i>do</i> Juliet?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Do it? Elegant! I sat in the second stage box with
the two Misses W. (Chestnut street belles!) and Colonel
S. and Sam. G., and his sister (all <i>nobs</i> of course!), and
they were truly entranced with Miss Kemble's Juliet! I
threw for Miss G. her elegant bouquet,&mdash;Fanny kissed her
fingers to me, and with a <i>look</i> at me, as I stood up so&mdash;(the beau
gave a tall <i>rear up</i> and was about to spread himself,
when glancing at the door, he sees&mdash;two ladies! right
in the store!) <i>thunder!</i>" he exclaims.</p>

<p>If the beau had been hit by a streak of lightning, he
would not have <i>dropped</i> sooner than he did, behind the counter.</p>

<p>The ladies proved to be <i>nobody</i> else than those of the
very two Misses W. themselves; they lived close by, and
frequently came to the store. Beneath our counter were
endless packages, broken glass, refuse oils, rancid perfumes,
dust, dirt, grease, charcoal, soap, and about everything else
dingy and offensive to the eye and nose. The place afforded
a wretched refuge for a hull so big and nice as our beau's,
but there he was, much in our <i>way</i> too, with the mournful
fact, for Charley, that if those "fine ladies" stayed less
than half an hour, without overhauling about every article
in the store, it would be a white stone indeed in the fortunes
of the beau! The ladies sat; they dickered and examined&mdash;we
exhibited and put away, the beau lying crouched
and crucifying at our feet, and we sniggering fit to
burst at the <i>contretemps</i> of the poor victim. Charley
stood it with the most heroic resignation for full twenty
minutes, when the two Misses W. got up to go. Casting
their eyes towards the door, who should be about to pass
but the divine Fanny!</p>

<p>Fanny Kemble! Seeing the two Misses W., whose recognition
and acquaintance was worth cultivating&mdash;even
by the haughty queen of the drama and belle of the hour;
she rushed in, they all had a talk&mdash;and you know how
women can talk, will <i>talk</i> for an hour or two, all about nothing
in particular, except to <i>talk</i>. Imagine our beau,&mdash;"Phancy
his phelinks," as <i>Yellow Plush</i> says, and to
heighten the effect, in comes the boss! He comes behind
the counter&mdash;he sees poor Charley sprawling&mdash;he roars out:</p>

<p>"By Jupiter! Mr. Whackstack, are you sick? <i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>"Dead?" utters Fanny.</p>

<p>"A man dead behind your counter, sir?" scream the Misses W.!</p>

<p>With one desperate <i>splurge</i>, up jumps the beau; rushes
out, up stairs&mdash;gets on his clothes, and we did not see him
again for over two years!</p>

<h2><a name="Selling_a_Landlord" id="Selling_a_Landlord"></a>"Selling" a Landlord.</h2>


<p>During the great gathering of people in Quakerdom,
while the Whigs were dovetailing in Old Zack,
an artful dodger, a queer quizzing Boston friend of mine,
thought a little <i>side play</i> wouldn't be out of the way, so to
work he goes to get up a muss, and I'll tell you how he
managed it, nice as wax.</p>

<p>Among the Boston delegates&mdash;self-constituted, <i>a la</i> Gen.
Commander&mdash;was a certain gentleman, remarkable for his
probity, decorum, and extreme sensitiveness. Well, A.,
the <i>wag</i>, and B., the <i>victim</i>, landed together, but selected,
in the general overflow and hurly-burly, different lodgings.
Next morning, A. finds B. stowed away in &mdash;&mdash;'s Hotel,
fine as a fiddle, snug as a bug, in a good room, and doing
about <i>as</i> well as could be expected. A. had had indifferent
luck, and the quarters he had lit upon were any thing
but comfortable, the inmates of the Hotel being stowed
away in <i>tiers</i>, like herrings in a box. A. thought he'd <i>oust</i>
his innocent and unsuspecting friend, and crack his joke,
if it cost a law suit, just for the sake of variety.</p>

<p>With the <i>address</i>, and <i>partly the</i> dress&mdash;a white hat&mdash;of
a man of the <i>mace</i>, A. steps up to the bar of &mdash;&mdash;'s Hotel,
and after carefully scrutinizing the register, finds the autograph
of the victim, then smiles suspiciously, enough to
say to the observant bar-keeper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aha! I've found him!" Then leaning cautiously forward
towards that person, says A.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is this man here yet? Is he in the house?"</p>

<p>"I b'leave he is, sur,&mdash;I know he is, sur," says the Milesian,
overlooking the register himself.</p>

<p>"Come here last night?" continues A., in his suspicious strain.</p>

<p>"He did, sur!" answers the grog-mixer.</p>

<p>"Has nothing but a valise and umbrella?" says A.</p>

<p>"Nothing else, sur, I believe," is the reply.</p>

<p>"That's him! that's him! I've found him!" exultantly
exclaims A., while the bar-keeper and landlord, who had
now come forward, eagerly wanted to know if any thing
was wrong with the gentleman whose arrival was being discussed.</p>

<p>"Step aside, sir," says A. to the proprietor; "I don't
want any disturbance made, at such a time; it might do
your fine establishment more harm than good; <i>but</i>, there is
a person stopping in your house that I have followed from
Boston; I have kept my eye on his movements(!); I know
his designs, his practices, <i>well</i>; I'm on his track&mdash;he
dodged me last night, but I've found him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, do you pretend to assert that this man (scrutinizing
the register) is a pick-pocket, a thief, or something of
the kind, sir?" earnestly inquired the proprietor.</p>

<p>"You keep <i>mum</i>, sir," said A., coolly tapping the lappel
of the landlord's coat&mdash;"I've got him <i>safe!</i> Let
him rest for awhile&mdash;I've got him! Do you understand?"
says the wag, winking a knowing, significant <i>wink</i> at the landlord.</p>

<p>"No, cuss me if I do understand you, sir!" sharply replies
the landlord. "If there is a dangerous or disreputable
person in my house, sir, I would thank you to tell me,
sir, and I will soon put him where the dogs won't bite him, sir!"</p>

<p>"There is no use of unnecessary alarm, my friend," says
A., in a low tone; "the truth is, this person whom I have
followed here, has made a heavy <i>draw</i> on one of our Boston
banks, by means of certain checks and certificates, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oho! That's it, eh?" interposes the landlord, beginning
to see his guest in a more <i>dignified</i> light, that of a
splendid thief; so his rigid frown, called in play by the
supposition that a petty rascal was on his premises, subsided
into a wise smile, which A. interrupts with&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've hit it; but keep quiet! Don't let us go too
<i>far</i> before we're sure the bird is in our cage. He's worth
attending to; I'm not sure he's <i>got</i> the abstracted money
about him; but when he settles with you, just notice the
size of his wallet, and its contents; may have an officer
handy, if you like. If he has a large roll of notes, especially
on the Traders' Bank, nab him, and keep him until I
come," said A.</p>

<p>"Where do you stop, sir?" inquired the landlord.</p>

<p>"At the&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, Chestnut street," A. replies.</p>

<p>"Shall be attended to, sir, I warrant you. Is there a
reward out, sir, for this person?" says the landlord.</p>

<p>"O! no; it has all been kept quiet. <i>Policy</i>, you see;
he left in such a hurry, he thought he'd be lost sight of in
this crowd here in your city. If he has the money, we'll
make 'a spec,' you understand?"</p>

<p>"I see, I see," said the befogged landlord; "I'll keep
a sharp look out for him, and let you know the moment I
find him fairly out."</p>

<p>That afternoon, as B. called for his bill at the bar of &mdash;&mdash;'s Hotel,
the landlord was <i>about</i>, all in a <i>twitter</i>, with
two policemen in the distance, and sundry especial friends
hanging about, to whom the landlord had unbosomed the
affair. All were anxiously watching the result of the business.
B. hands forth his capacious wallet, stuffed with
"<i>documents</i>" of the Traders' Bank, of Boston,&mdash;from which
institution he had <i>drawn</i> a pile of funds, to invest in coal
at Richmond,&mdash;and no sooner did B. place an X, of the
Traders' Bank, upon the bar, than the excited landlord's
eyes danced like shot on a hot shovel, and giving the
constables the <i>cue</i>, poor B. found <ins title="himsesf">himself</ins> <i>waited upon</i>, in a
brace of shakes, by those two custodians, while the landlord
grabbed the wallet out of B.'s hand, with a suddenness
that completely mesmerized him.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," says the landlord to the officers, "do your duty!"</p>

<p>"Why, look here!" says B., squirming about in the
grasp of the officers, and reaching over for the landlord
and his wallet&mdash;"what the thunder are you about? Come,
I say, none of your darn'd nonsense now; let me go, I tell
you, and hand back that wallet, Mister &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>But B. was "a goner." They favored him with no explanation,
of course, and were about trotting him forth to
the Mayor's office, when a well known Anthracite merchant
came in, in quest of B. Some inquiry followed, explanation
ensued, and the result was, that after poor B.
got a little reconciled to the <i>joke</i>, he joined issue with a
laughing chorus at the expense of the <i>sold</i> landlord, who,
in consideration of all hands keeping <i>mum</i>, put the party
through a course of juleps.</p>

<p>I may as well observe, that I regret there is no particular
<i>moral</i> to this sketch.</p>

<h2><a name="that_Poor_Woman" id="that_Poor_Woman"></a>Who was that Poor Woman?</h2>


<p>I do not know a feminine&mdash;from the piney woods of
Maine to the Neuces&mdash;so given to popularity, newspaper
philippics, and city item bombards, as Aunt Nabby
Folsom, of the town of Boston. The name and doings of
Aunt Nabby are linked with nearly all popular cabals in
Faneuil Hall, the "Temple," "Chapel," or Melodeon&mdash;from
funeral orations to political caucusses&mdash;Temperance
jubilees to Abolition flare ups; for Aunt Nabby never
allows <i>wind</i>, weather or subject, time, place or occasion, to
prevent her "full attendance." The police, and over-zealous
auditors, at times <i>snake her down</i> or crowd her old
straw bonnet, but Aunt Nabby is always sure of the polite
attention of the "Reporters," and shines in their notes,
big as the biggest toad in the puddle.</p>

<p>Indeed, Aunt Nabby is one of 'em!&mdash;a perfect she-male
Mike Walsh. She will have her <i>say</i>, though a legion of
constables stood at the door; her principal <i>stand-point</i> is
the freedom of speech and woman's rights, and she goes in
tooth and nail <i>agin law</i>, Marshal Tukey, and the entire
race-root and rind of the Quincys&mdash;particularly strong!
Aunt Nabby is subject to a series, too tedious to mention,
of "sells" by the <i>quid nuncs</i> and rapscallions of the day,
and one of these "sells" is the pith of my present paper.</p>

<p>It so fell out, when Jenny Lind arrived here, about every
fool within five-and-fifty miles ran their heels and brazen
faces after the Nightingale and her carriage wherever she
went, from her bed-chamber to her dinner table, from her
drawing-room to the Concert Hall. It took Barnum and
his whole "private secretary" force and equal number of
policemen and servants, besides Stephens himself, of the
Revere, and his bar-keeper, to keep the mob from rushing
pell-mell up stairs and surrounding Jenny as Paddy did the Hessians.</p>

<p>Now and then a desperate fellow got in&mdash;had an audience,
grinned, backed down and went his way, tickled as a
dog with two tails. Others were victimized by notes from
Barnum (!) or Miss Lind's "private secretary," offering an
interview, and many of these transactions were "rich and
racy" enough, in all conscience, for the pages of a modern
Joe Miller. But Aunt Nabby Folsom's time was about
as rich as the raciest, and will bear rehearsing&mdash;easy.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said a pleasing-looking, neatly-dressed,
elderly lady, to the two scant yards of starch and
dickey behind Stephens' slab of marble at the Revere.</p>

<p>"Good morning, ma'am," responded the <i>clark</i>, who, not
knowing exactly who the lady was, <i>jerked</i> down his well-oiled
and brushed "wig and whiskers" to the entire satisfaction
of the matronly lady, who went on to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish to see Miss Lind, sir."</p>

<p>"Guess she's engaged, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Well, but I've an invitation, sir, from Miss Lind, to
call at 9 A. M. to-day. I like to be punctual, sir; my time
is quite precious; I called precisely as desired; Miss Lind
appointed the time; and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, very well, ma'am," said the <i>clark</i>, with
a flourish, "if Miss Lind has invited you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, of course she has! Here's her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, never mind, ma'am; all correct, I presume."</p>

<p>The "pipes" and bells soon had the attendance of a gang
of white-jacketed, polish-faced Paddies, and the elderly
lady was marshalled, double-file, towards the apartments of
the Nightingale.</p>

<p>Jenny had but just "turned out," and was "feeding"
on the right wing and left breast of a lark, the leg of a
canary, "a dozen fried" humming bird eggs&mdash;her customary
fodder of a morning.</p>

<p>The servants passed the countersigns, and the elderly
lady was admitted&mdash;the Nightingale, without disturbing the
ample folds of her camel's hair dressing-gown&mdash;a present
from the Sultan of all the Turkies, cost $3,000&mdash;motioned
the matron to squat, and as soon as she got her throat in
talking order, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Goot mornins."</p>

<p>"How do you do?" responds the old lady.</p>

<p>"Pooty well, tank'ees. You have some breakest? No!"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. I've had my breakfast three hours ago."</p>

<p>"Yes? indeed! you rise up early, eh?&mdash;Well, it is goot
for ze hels, eh?"</p>

<p>"So my doctor says," responded the matron. "But I
like to get up and be stirring around."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes; you stir around, eh? What you stir around?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Lind, I'll tell you what I stir around.
I-stir-the-monsters
(Miss Lind looks sharp)
who-try-to-trample-on-the-universal-rights-<i>of-woman!</i>
(The matron 'up'
and gesticulating like the brakes of an engine&mdash;Miss Lind
drops her eating tools&mdash;eyes of the two servants bulge out!)
A-n-d I-stir-the-demagogues-who-assemble-in-Faneuil-Hall
(down with the brakes!), to prevent-the-freedom-of-speech
(rush upon the brakes!), a-a-n-d-put-me-down!"</p>

<p>It was evident that the appetite of the Nightingale was
getting spoiled&mdash;she looked suspicious, and, just in time to
prevent the female orator&mdash;who was no other personage,
of course, than Aunt Nabby Folsom, from ripping into a
regular caucus fanfaronade of gamboge and gas, a knock
upon the door announced a "call" for Miss Lind, to dress
and appear to a fresh lot of bores&mdash;yclept the Mayor and
his suit of Deacons, soup, pork and bean-venders.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes; I will be ready in one min't. Madame, you
will please come again; once more, adieu&mdash;good mornins&mdash;adieu!"</p>

<p>And Aunt Nabby, in spite of her ancient teeth, found
herself bowed&mdash;half way down stairs&mdash;into the hall, and
clean out doors, before she caught her breath to say another
word upon the interminable subject of the freedom of
speech and woman's rights!</p>

<p>But Aunt Nabby "blowed"&mdash;O! didn't she <i>blow</i> to
the various tea and toast coteries, scandal and slang express
women&mdash;and the various knots of anxious crowds who
stood about Bowdoin Square during the Lind mania!
Aunt Nabby had had a genuine <i>tete-a-tete</i> with the Nightingale&mdash;and,
ecod, an invitation to call again! But
Jenny Lind, and her cordon of sentinels, secretaries and
suckers, were "fly" for the old screech owl, when again
and again she beset the <i>clark</i> and the stairways of the Revere.
Though Aunt Nabby hung on and growled dreadfully,
she finally caved in and kept away.</p>

<p>When Jenny Lind gave the proceeds of one concert to
charitable purposes, among the items set down in the list
was&mdash;"A poor woman&mdash;<i>one hundred dollars!</i>"</p>

<p>"Why, it's you, of course," said a <i>quid-nunc</i>, to Aunt
Abby, as she held the Evening Transcript in her hands, in
the store of Redding &amp; Co., and observed the interesting
item above alluded to.</p>

<p>"Well, so I think," says Aunt Nabby. "If I ain't a
poor woman, and a var-tuous woman, and a good and <i>true
woman</i> (down came her brakes on the book piles), I'd like
to know where&mdash;<i>where</i>, on this univarsal <i>yearth</i> (down
with the brakes), you'd find one! One hundred dollars to
a poor woman," she continued, reading the item. "I must
be the person&mdash;yes, Abigail, <i>thou art the man!</i>" she concluded
in her favorite apothegm.</p>

<p>The <i>quid</i> gave Abby the residence of the Agent (!) who
was to disburse the Lind charities, and away went Abby
to the Agent, who happened to be an amateur joker; knowing
Aunt Abby, and smelling a "sell," he told the old 'un
that Mr. Somerby, of No.&nbsp;&mdash; Cornhill, the joker of the
Post, was the Agent, and would shell out next morning, at
nine o'clock. At that hour, S. had Aunt Nabby in his
sanctum. He knew the ropes, so assured Abby that there
was a mistake; Charles Davenport, of Cornhill, rear of
Joy's building, was the man. Charles D. informed Aunt
Nabby, that he had declined to disburse for Miss Lind, but
that Bro. Norris, of the Yankee Blade, had the pile, and
was serving it out to an excited mob. Norris declared
that she was in error. She was not, by a jug full, the only,
poor woman in town, and didn't begin to be <i>the</i> poor woman
set forth in Miss Lind's schedule! But Aunt Nabby wasn't
to be <i>done!</i> She besieged Miss Lind&mdash;followed her to the
cars&mdash;mounted the platform&mdash;Jenny espied her, and to
avoid a harangue on the freedom of speech and woman's
rights, hid her head in her cloak. The last exclamation the
Nightingale heard from the screech owl, was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Jane Lind&mdash;who was that poor wom-a-n?"</p>

<h2><a name="and_his_Mother" id="and_his_Mother"></a>Andrew Jackson and his Mother.</h2>


<p>It is a most singular, or at least curious fact, connected
with the histories of most all eminent men, that they
were denied&mdash;by the decrees of stern poverty, or an all-wise
Providence&mdash;those facilities and indulgences supposed to
be so essentially necessary for the future success and prosperous
career of young men, but acted as "whetstones" to
sharpen and develop their true temper! The fact is very
vivid in the early history of Andrew Jackson&mdash;a name that,
like that of the great, godlike Washington, must survive the
wreck of matter, the crush of worlds, and, passing down the
vista of each successive age, brighter and more glorious,
unto those generations yet to come, when time shall have
obliterated the asperities of partisan feeling, and learned to
deal most gently with the human frailties of the illustrious dead.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson, senior, emigrated from Ireland in 1765,
with his wife and two boys&mdash;Hugh and Robert, both very
young; they landed at Charleston, S. C, where Jackson
found employment as a laborer, and continued to work
thus for several years, until, possessed of a few dollars, he
went to the interior of the state and bought a small place
near Waxhaw. About this time, 1767, Andrew Jackson, Jr.,
was born, and during the next year&mdash;by the time the infant
could lisp the name of his parent&mdash;the father fell sick of fever
and died. Mrs. Jackson, left with three small children, in
an almost wild country, where nothing but toil of a severe
and arduous kind could provide a subsistence, was indeed
in a most grievous situation. But she appears to have been
a woman of no ordinary temperament, courage, and
perseverance, for she continued cheerfully the work left her&mdash;rearing
her boys, and preparing them for the situations in
life they might be destined to fill. Mrs. Jackson was a
woman of some information, and a strong advocate for the
rights and liberties of men; as, it is said, she not only gave
her boys their first rudiments of an English education, but
often indulged in glowing lectures to them of the importance
of instilling in their hearts and principles an unrelenting
war against pomp, power, and circumstance of monarchical
governments and institutions! She led them to know
that they were born free and equal with the best of earth,
and that that position was to be their heritage&mdash;maintained
even at the peril of life and property! and how well he
learned these chivalric lessons, the countrymen of Andrew
Jackson need not now be told, as it was exemplified in every
page of his whole history.</p>

<p>Hugh, Robert, and Andrew, were now the widow's hope
and treasures; Hugh and Robert were her main dependence
in working their little farm, and Andrew, never a
very robust person, was early sent to the best schools in
the neighborhood, and much care taken by his mother to
have him at least educated for a profession&mdash;the ministry.
This resolve was more perhaps decided upon from the naturally
stern, contemplative, and fixed principles of young
Jackson; as at the early age of fifteen, he was by nature
well prepared for the scenes being enacted around him, and
in which, even those young as himself, were called upon to
take an active part. This was in the days of the revolution,
when the weak in numbers of this continent were
about to try the <i>experiment</i> of living free and independent,
and establish the fact that royalty was an imposition and a
humbug, only maintained by arrogance and pomp at the
point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>The British had begun the war&mdash;already had the echoes
of "Bunker Hill," and the smell of "villainous saltpetre,"
invaded and aroused the quiet dwellers in the woods and
wilds of South Carolina, and the chivalric spirit that has
ever characterized the men of the Palmetto state, at once
responded to the tocsin of <i>liberty</i>. It was with no slight
degree of sorrow and aching of the mother's heart, that she
saw her two sons, Hugh and Robert, shoulder their muskets
and join the Spartan band that assembled at Waxhaw
Court-house. But she blessed her children and gave up
her holy claim of a mother's love, for the common cause of
the infant nation.</p>

<p>Cornwallis and his army crossed the Yadkin, Lord Rawden,
with a large force, took the town of Camden, and
began a desolation of the adjacent country. Being apprised
of a "rebel force" in arms at Waxhaw, he immediately
dispatched a company of dragoons, with a company
of infantry, to capture or disperse the "rebels." About
forty men, including the two boys Jackson, were attacked
by these veterans of the British army, but aided by their
true courage, a good cause, and perfect knowledge of the
country, they gave the invaders a hot reception, and many
of the enemy were killed; and not until having made the
most determinate resistance, and being overwhelmed by the
great majority of the opposing forces, did these patriots
retreat, leaving many of their friends dead upon their soil,
and eleven of their number prisoners in the hands of the
British. It was during this fight that Andrew Jackson&mdash;a
mere lad&mdash;hearing the noise of the conflict, while he sat in
the log-house of his mother, besought her to allow him to
take his father's gun, and fly to join his brothers. And it
was vain that the parent restrained him, knowing the temperament
of the boy, from this dangerous determination;
for with one warm embrace and parting kiss upon the brow
of his mother, Andrew Jackson buckled on his powder-horn
and bullet-pouch, and rushed to the scene of battle.
But his friends were already flying, and hotly pursued by
the enemy. Andrew met his brother Robert, who informed
him of the death of their elder brother, Hugh; the two
boys now fled together and concealed themselves in the
woods, where they lay until hunger drove them forth&mdash;they
sought food at a farm house, the owner of which proved to
be a <i>tory</i>, and gave information to some soldiers in the vicinity&mdash;the
Jacksons were both captured and led to prison.
In the affray&mdash;for they yielded only by force&mdash;Robert was
cut on the head by a sword in the hands of a petty officer,
and he died in great agony in prison. It was here and
then that the firm and manly bearing of the boy was exhibited;
for he stood his griefs and imprisonment like a true
hero. Not a tear escaped him by which his enemies might
be led to believe he feared their power, or wavered in his
allegiance to the cause of his country.</p>

<p>"Here, <i>boy</i>, clean my boots!" said an officer to him.
But the bright defiant eye of the boy smote the captor with
a look, and as he curled his firm lips in scorn, he answered,</p>

<p>"No, sir, I will <i>not!</i>"</p>

<p>"You won't? I'll tie you, you young saucy rebel, to
your post, and skin your back with a horse whip, if you do
not clean my boots."</p>

<p>"Do it," said the lion-hearted boy&mdash;"for I'll not stoop
to clean the boots of your master!"</p>

<p>The infuriated ruffian drew his sword, and to defend his
head from the blow, Andrew threw up his little hand and
received a gash&mdash;the scar of which went with him to the
tomb at the Hermitage. A Captain Walker, of South Carolina,
with a dozen or twenty men, during the imprisonment
of Andrew Jackson, made a desperate charge upon a
company of the British, near Camden, and captured thirteen
of them; these prisoners he exchanged for seven of his
countrymen, including the boy Andrew Jackson, prisoners
of the enemy. Andrew hurried home&mdash;his poor old mother
was upon her death bed, attended by an old negro nurse of
the Jackson family, and suffering not only from the great
multitude of grief consequent upon the death of her heroic
sons, but for want of the common necessaries of life, the
invaders having stripped the widow of her last pound of
provisions. The life-spark rekindled in the eye of the mother,
as she beheld her darling boy safe at her bedside&mdash;she
grasped his hand with the firmness of a dying woman,
and turning her eyes upon the now weeping boy, said,</p>

<p>"Andrew, I leave you,&mdash;son, you will soon be alone in
the world; be faithful, be true to God and your
country&mdash;that&mdash;when&mdash;the&mdash;hour of death approaches you&mdash;will
have&mdash;nothing to&mdash;dread&mdash;every thing&mdash;to hope for."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Andrew was taken ill after the burial of his mother, and
but for the constant and tender care of the old black nurse&mdash;the
last of the Jackson family&mdash;would have then passed
away; he recovered&mdash;he was alone&mdash;not a relative in the
world; poor, and in a land ravaged by a foreign foe, could
a boy be more desolate and lonely? With a few "effects"
thrown upon his shoulders, he went to North Carolina, Salisbury,
where he entered the office of a famed lawyer&mdash;Spruce
M'Cay&mdash;was admitted to the bar in 1778&mdash;went to
Tennessee&mdash;served as a soldier in the Indian wars of 1783&mdash;chosen
a Senator 1797&mdash;Major General in 1801&mdash;whipped
the British in the most conclusive manner at New Orleans
in 1815, and triumphantly elected President of the United
States for eight years in 1829. Andrew Jackson followed
his mother's advice, and he not only triumphed over his
hard fortune, but died a Christian, full of hope, in 1845.</p>

<h2><a name="Snaking_out_Sturgeons" id="Snaking_out_Sturgeons"></a>Snaking out Sturgeons.</h2>


<p>We have roared until our ribs fairly ached, at the
relation of the following "item" on sturgeons, by
a loquacious friend of ours:&mdash;</p>

<p>It appears our friend was located on the Kennebec river,
a few years ago, and had a number of hands employed about
a dam, and the sturgeons were very numerous and extremely
docile. They would frequently come poking their noses
close up to the men standing in the water, and one of the men
bethought him how delicious a morsel of pickled sturgeon
was, and he forthwith made a preparation to "snake out" a
clever-sized fish. Getting an iron rod at the blacksmith's
shop, close at hand, he bends up one end like a fish hook,
and, slipping out into the stream, he slily places the hook
under the sturgeon's nose and into its round hole of a
mouth, expecting to fasten on to the victimized, harmless
fish, and "yank" him clean and clear out of his watery element.
But, "lordy," wasn't he mistaken and surprised!
The moment the hook touched the inside of the sturgeon's
mouth, the creature backed water so sudden and forcibly as
to near jerk the holder of the hook's head from its socket.
The poor fellow was forty rods under water, and going
down stream, before he mustered presence of mind enough
to induce him to let go the hook!</p>

<p>However, the lookers-on of this curious man&oelig;uvre took
a boat and fished out their half-drowned comrade, who
concluded that he had paid pretty dearly for his whistle.</p>

<p>The sturgeon-catching did not end here. After the
laugh of the above-mentioned adventure had ceased, some
one offered to bet a hat that he could hold a sturgeon and
snake him clean out of the water; and as the man who <i>had</i>
tried the experiment felt altogether dubious about it, he at
once bet that the sturgeon would be more than a match for
any man in the crowd.</p>

<p>The wager was duly staked, a rod crooked, the operator
tucked up his sleeves and trowsers, and wades out to where
a sturgeon or two were lying off in the shallow water. Of
course the operation now became a matter of considerable
interest; and as the man was a stout, hearty fellow, able to
hold a bull by the horns, few entertained doubts of his
bringing out <i>his</i> sturgeon.</p>

<p>After a long time the operator gets his hook under the
sturgeon, and leans forward to stick it close into the jaws
of the victim; and no sooner was that part of the feat accomplished,
than Mr. Sturgeon "backs out" with the velocity
of chain lightning, carrying his assailant under water
and down stream! The man held on; and there they went,
foaming and pitching, until the fellow, finding his breath
nearly out of his body; his neck, arms, and legs just about
dislocated, concluded to lose the hat and let the hook and
sturgeon go!</p>

<p>Pretty well used up, the poor fellow succeeded in getting
out of the river, a convert to the first experimental idea of
the strength and velocity of fish, especially a big sturgeon.</p>

<p>Beginning to imagine that fish could swim, or had some
muscular power, several of the bystanders were rife for experimenting
on the sturgeons.</p>

<p>Another iron rod was converted into a hook, and two
burly-built Paddys volunteered to hook the fish. An opportunity
was not long waited for, ere a jolly good elastic
nosed genus sturgeon came smelling up close to where the
Paddys had posted themselves upon some moss-covered,
slippery stones, and with a sudden spasmodic effort, the
man with the hook planted it firmly into the suction hole of
the fish, while his companion held on to a rope fast to the
hook. Before Pat could say Jack Robinson, of course he
was jerked off his feet, and, letting go the iron, the other
Paddy and the sturgeon set sail, having all the fun to themselves!
This proved, or very nearly so, a serious <i>denouement</i>
to the sturgeon-catching by hand, for Paddy was carried
clean and clear off soundings, and so repeatedly
immersed in deep water, that his life was within an ace of
being wet out of his body. The rope parted at last (poor
Pat never thought of letting go his "hould"), and being
dipped out of the liquid element and rolled over a barrel
until his insides were emptied of the water, and heat restored
through the influence of whiskey, he recovered, and
further experimenting on sturgeons, that season, in the
Kennebec, ceased.</p>

<h2><a name="the_Wrong_Passenger" id="the_Wrong_Passenger"></a>Waking up the Wrong Passenger.</h2>


<p>In "comparing notes" with a travelled friend, I glean
from his stock of information, gathered South-west, a
few incidents in the life of a somewhat extensively famed
Boston panoramic artist&mdash;one of which incidents, at least,
is worth rehearsing. Some years ago, the South-west was
beset by an organized coalition of desperadoes, whose daring
outrages kept travellers and the dwellers in the Mississippi
valley in continual fear and anxiety. "Running niggers"
was one of the most popular and profitable branches of the
business pursuits of these gentlemen freebooters, and, next
to horse-stealing, was the most practised.</p>

<p>At length, the citizens "measured swords" with the freebooters,
or land pirates, more properly; forming themselves
into committees, the citizens opened <i>Court</i> and practised
Judge Lynch's <i>code</i> upon a multitude of just occasions.
At the time of which we write, Mill's Point, on the Mississippi,
was no great shakes of a <i>town</i>, but a spot where a
very considerable amount of whiskey was drank, and a corresponding
quantity of crime and desperate doings were
enacted; indeed, some of the worst scenes in Southern
Kentucky's tragic dramas were performed there. It so fell
out, that some of the land pirates had been actively engaged
in levying upon the negroes and mules around Mill's Point,
and the protective committee were on the alert to capture
and administer the law upon these fellows. It was discovered,
one evening, as the shades of a black and rather
tempestuous night were closing upon the mighty "father
of waters" and his ancient banks, that a mysterious <i>voyageur</i>,
or sort of piratical <i>vidette</i>, was seen in his light canoe,
hugging the shore, either for shelter or some insidious purpose.</p>

<p>The canoe and its navigator were diligently watched;
but the coming storm and darkness soon closed observation,
and the parties noticing the transaction hurried forward to
the <i>Point</i>, and announced one or more of the land pirates
in the neighborhood! Of course, the town&mdash;of some four
houses, six "groceries," a <i>store</i> and blacksmithery&mdash;was
aroused, indignant! Impatient for a victim, the <i>posse
comitatus</i> "fired up," armed to the teeth with pistol,
bludgeon, blunderbuss, gun, bowie-knife, and&mdash;whiskey,
started up the river to reconnoitre and intercept the pirate
and his crew.</p>

<p>Each nook and corner along shore, for some three miles,
was carefully&mdash;as much so as the darkness would admit&mdash;scoured.
The Storm-King rode by, the stars again twinkled
in the azure-arched heavens, and soon, too, the bright silver
moon beamed forth, and suddenly one of the vigilant
committee espies the land-pirate and his canoe noiselessly
floating down the rapid stream! No time was to be lost;
the committee man, rather pleased with the fact of his
being the first to make the discovery, apprised a comrade,
and the two hurried back to the Point, to get a canoe and
start out to capture the enemy. The canoe was obtained, three
courageous men, armed to the teeth, as the saying goes,
paddled off, and indeed they had not far to paddle, for
right ahead they saw the mysterious canoe of the enemy!
Where was the pirate? Asleep! Lying down in his
frail vessel; either asleep, or "playing possum." At all
events, the Mills-Pointers gave the enemy but a brief period
to sleep or act; for, dashing alongside, a brawny arm
seized the victim in the strange canoe by the breast and
throat, with such a rush and fierceness that both canoes
were upon the apex of "swamping."</p>

<p>"Don't move! Don't budge an inch, or you're a case
for eels, you thief!"</p>

<p>"Make catfish bait of him at once!" yelled the second.</p>

<p>"Don't move," cried the third, "don't move, you possum,
or you're giblets, instanter!"</p>

<p>But these injunctions scarcely seemed necessary, for, even
had the captive been so inclined, he neither possessed the
power nor opportunity to move a limb.</p>

<p>"Haul him out," cried one.</p>

<p>"Yes, lug him into our boat," said another; "so now,
you skunk, lay still; don't open your trap, or I'll brain you
on sight!"</p>

<p>Having transferred the body of the captive from his
"own canoe" to theirs, the Mills-Pointers made fast the
stranger's <i>dug-out</i>, and then paddled for the landing. The
pirate was duly hauled ashore, or on to the <i>wharf-boat</i>,
and left under guard of one of the captors&mdash;a dreadful ugly-looking
customer, a <i>cross</i> between a whiskey-cask, bowie-knife,
and a Seminole Indian or bull-dog, and armed equal
to an arsenal&mdash;while the other two went up to the nearest
"grocery," reported the capture, took a drink, and sent out
word for <i>Court</i> to meet. The poor victim was deposited
on his back across some barrels, with his hands tied behind
him. Recovering his scattered senses, the <i>pirate</i>
"waked up."</p>

<p>"Look here, my virtuous friend," said he to his body-guard,
who sat on an opposite barrel, with a heavy pistol
in his hand, "what's all this about?"</p>

<p>"Shet up!" responded the guard; "shet up your gourd.
You'll know what's up, pooty soon, you ugly cuss, you!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's explicit, anyhow!" coolly continued the
captive. "But all I want to know, is&mdash;am I to be robbed,
killed off, or only initiated into the mysteries of your craft?"</p>

<p><a name='Pg_305' id='Pg_305'></a>"Shet up, you piratin' cuss, you; shet up, or I'll give
you a settler!" was the reply.</p>

<p>"Shet up, you piratin' cuss you; shet up or I'll give you
a settler!&mdash;<a href='#Pg_305'><i>Page</i> 305.</a></p>

</div>

<p>"Well, really, you are accommodating," cavalierly replied
the but little daunted captive. "One thing consoling
I glean, my virtuous friend, from your scraps of information&mdash;you
are not a pirate yourself, or in favor of that science!
But I should like to know, old fellow, where I am, and
what the deuce I'm here for."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll soon diskiver the perticklers, for here comes
the <i>Court</i>, and they'll have you dancin' on nothin' and kickin'
at the wind, pooty soon; you kin stake your pile on that!"</p>

<p>And with this, a hum was heard, and soon a mob of a
dozen well-<i>stimulated</i> citizens, and strangers about the
Point, came rushing and yelling on to the wharf-boat and
were quite as immediately gathered around the captive.
The first impulse of the <i>posse comitatus</i> appeared to manifest
itself in a desire to hang the victim&mdash;straight up! A
second (how <i>sober</i> we know not) thought induced them to
ask a question or two, and for this purpose the presiding
<i>judge</i> drew up before the still prostrate captive, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you? What have you got to say for yourself, anyhow?"</p>

<p>The sunburnt, ragged, and rather romantic-looking prisoner
turned his face towards the <i>judge</i>, and replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have nothing of consequence to say, neighbor. I
would like to know, however, what all this means!"</p>

<p>"Where's your crew, you villain?" said the <i>judge</i>.</p>

<p>"Crew? I have never found it necessary to have any,
neighbor; navigation never engrossed a great deal of my
attention, but I get along down here very well&mdash;without a crew!"</p>

<p>"You do?" responded the <i>judge</i>; "well, we're going to
hang you up."</p>

<p>"You are, eh?" was the cool reply; "well, I have
always been opposed to capital punishment, neighbor, and
I know it would be unpleasant to me now!"</p>

<p>The quiet manner of his reply rather won upon the <i>Court</i>,
and says the <i>judge</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you, and where are you from?"</p>

<p>"My name is Banvard&mdash;John Banvard, from Boston!"</p>

<p>"It is, eh? What are you doing along here, alone in a canoe?"</p>

<p>"<i>Taking a panorama of the Mississippi, neighbor, that's all.</i>"</p>

<p>The <i>Court</i> adjourned <i>sine die</i>; the clever artist was untied,
treated to the best the market afforded, that night;
his canoe, rifle, &amp;c., restored next day, and John went on
his way rejoicing in his narrow escape&mdash;finished his sketches,
and the first great panorama "got up" in our country, and
which he took to Europe, after making a fortune by it in America.</p>

<p>"<i>Have you got any ole boots?</i>"</p>

<p>Drove my respected&mdash;middle-aged friend Mansfield&mdash;clear
out of town! Mr. Mansfield was a <i>retired</i> flour merchant;
he was not rich, but well to do in the world. He
had no children of his own, in lieu of which, however, he
had become responsible for the "bringing up" of two
orphans of a friend. One of these children was a boy, old
enough to be <i>devilish</i> and mightily inclined that way. The
boy's name was Philip, the foster father he called Uncle
Henry, and not long after arriving in town, and opening
house at the South End, Mr. Mansfield&mdash;who was given
to quiet musings, book and newspaper reading&mdash;found that
he was likely to become a victim to the aforesaid hawkers,
pedlers and old boot collectors.</p>

<p>Uncle Henry stood it for a few months, with the firmness
of an experienced philosopher, laying the flattering unction
to his soul that, however harrowing&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Got any ole boots to-day?</i>"</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'>might be to him, for the present, he could grin and bear
and finally get used to it, as other people did. But Uncle
Henry possessed an irritable and excitable temperament,
that not one man in ten thousand could boast of, and hence
he grew&mdash;at length sour, then savage, and, finally, quite
meat-axish, towards every outsider who dared to ring his
bell, and proffer wooden ware and tin fixins, for rags and
rubbers, or make the never-to-be-forgotten inquiry&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Have you got any ole boots to-day?</i>"</p>

<p>Always at home, seated in his front parlor, and his frugal
wife not permitting the expense of a servant, Uncle Henry,
or Master Philip, were obliged to wait on the door. The
old gentleman finally concluded that the pedlers and old boot
collectors, more as a matter of daily amusement than profit
or concern&mdash;gave him a call. And laboring under this impression,
Uncle Henry determined to give the nuisances, as
he called them, a reception commensurate with their impertinence
and his worked up ire.</p>

breakfast, "we'll fix these&mdash;</p>

bells, clean out by the very roots, making us drop all, to
come wait on them, rot them&mdash;</p>

<p>"'<i>Got any ole boots?</i>'</p>

<p>"I'll give you old boots, by the lord Harry; I'll give
you a dose of something you won't forget, to your dying day."</p>

<p>And thus jabbering, fixing and pushing about the revolving
shelf, over his hall door, Mr. Mansfield worked
away at his trap. Like that of most dwellings in Boston,
Uncle Henry's front door was <i>sunk</i> some six or eight feet
into the face of the house, reached by a flight of six granite
steps&mdash;side and top lights to the door, in the ordinary way,
with brass plate and bell pull. It was in a neighborhood
not <i>plebeian</i> enough to induce butcher boys to enter the
hall, with the pork and potatoes, nor admit of the servant
girl heaving "slops" out of the front windows; yet not
sufficiently parvenu to impress pedlers and</p>

<p>"<i>Got any ole boots?</i>"</p>

<p style='text-indent:0;'>with aristocratic or "respectable" <i>awe</i>, ere venturing to
mount the steps, pull the bell, and mention tin pots, scrap
iron, rags and old leather. Mr. Mansfield was inclined to
<i>chuckle</i> in his sleeves at the <i>ruse</i> he would be enabled to
give his tormentors through the agency of his revolving
battery&mdash;charged with ground charcoal and brick dust, to
be worked by himself or Philly, by means of a string on the
inside. Philly was duly initiated into the <i>modus operandi</i>; when&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Got any ole boots?</i>"</p>

<p style='text-indent:0;'>made his appearance, amid his pyramid of leather, or a
pedler's wagon was seen in the neighborhood, Philly was
to be on the <i>qui vive</i>, inform Uncle Henry, and if they
mounted the steps, he would give them a shower bath upon
a new and astonishing principle.</p>

<p>It was perfect "nuts" for Master Phil; he was tickled
at the idea, and readily agreed to Uncle Henry's propositions.
Not long after arranging the "infernal machine,"
Uncle Henry's attention was called to another part of the
house; a dire calamity had befallen the Canary bird; a
strange cat had pounced upon the cage&mdash;the door flew
open, and puss nabbed the little warbler. Philly, on the
look out, in front, discovers two old boot men approaching
the neighborhood; desirous of showing his own skill, he did
not call Uncle Henry, but posted himself behind the door&mdash;string
in hand, awaiting the <i>cue</i>. Feet approach&mdash;quickly
the feet mount the steps.</p>

<p>"<i>Ding al ling, ding de ding, ding, ding, ding!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Sh-i-i-s-swashe!</i>" and down comes the avalanche of
coal dust and refined brick, the bulk of a peck, fair measurement!</p>

<p>Uncle Henry reached the door just in time to see the
penny postman covered from head to foot with the obnoxious
composition! Philly took occasion to make a
sudden exit, the postman swore&mdash;swore like a trooper, but
Uncle Henry managed to pack the whole transaction upon
the "devilish boy"&mdash;brushed the postman's clothes, and
after some effort, so mollified him as to induce the sufferer
to depart in peace. Uncle Henry <i>tried</i> to be very severe
on Philly, but it was very evident to that hopeful that the
old gentleman was more tickled than serious. Philly
cleared the steps, and the old gentleman re-arranged the
trap, admonishing Philly not to dare to meddle with it
again, but call him when&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Got any ole boots?</i>" made their appearance.</p>

<p>All was quiet up to noon next day; Uncle Henry had
business down town, and left the house at 9 A. M. Philly
was at school, but got home before Uncle Henry, and
seeing the pedler wagon near the door&mdash;slipped in, and
learning that the old gentleman was out, he gladly took
charge of the battery again. Now, just as the pedler
mounted the steps of the next door, Mr. Mansfield sees
him, and hurries up his own steps, to be on the watch for
the pedler. Philly had been <ins title="peaking">peeking</ins> out the corner of the
side curtain, and seeing the pedler coming, as he thought,
right up the steps&mdash;nabbed the string, and as Uncle Henry
caught the knob of the door&mdash;down came thundering the
brick dust and charcoal both, in the most elegant profusion.</p>

<p>Phil was <i>tricked</i>. Uncle Henry's vociferations were equal
to that of a drunken beggar&mdash;the trap was removed, Uncle
Henry got disgusted with city life, and left&mdash;for rural retirement,
without as much as giving one single rebuke to&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Got any ole boots to-day?</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="Vagaries_of_Nature" id="Vagaries_of_Nature"></a>The Vagaries of Nature.</h2>


<p>Nature seems to have her fitful, frightful, and funny
moods, as well as all her children. Now she gets up
a stone bridge, the gigantic proportions and the symmetrical
development of which attract great attention from all
tourists and historians who venture into or speak of "old
Virginia." The old dame goes down far into the bowels
of Mother Earth, in Kentucky, and builds herself, silently
and alone, a stupendous under-ground palace, that laughs
to scorn the puny efforts of man in that branch of business.
She gets up sugar-loaf mountains, pillars of salt, great
granite breastworks, and stone towers; hews out figure-heads,
old men's noses on the beetling cliffs of New Hampshire,
and throws up rocky palisades along the Hudson,
that win wonder and delight from the floating million.
Instances out of all number might be raked up, home and
abroad, to show how the old dame has cut <i>didoes</i> in the
prosecution of her manifold duties. But in Australia, it
would seem, nature has taken most especial pains to appear
slightly ridiculous or very eccentric.</p>

<p>Old Captain Rocksalt informs us&mdash;and there is always
wit, wisdom, and truth in the old man's stories&mdash;that he
made voyages to Australia many times within the past
thirty years, and having visited about all the sea-ports of
the Continent, lived and almost died in Australia, his notes
are worthy of attention. Capt. Cook discovered and named
<i>Botany Bay</i>, the name originating from the fact that the
land was covered with a luxurious growth of Botanical
specimens. The Dutch discovered and named <i>Van Diemen's
Land</i>. The English at once concluded to make
Botany Bay a penal colony, and the first living freight of
criminals and soldiers sent out, was some 700 in number,
in 1788; but Capt. Phillip, the commander of the fleet,
being dissatisfied with the looks of Botany Bay, hunted up
a better place, and sailed to it. When Capt. Cook was
cruising off there, one of his sailors, on the look out, cried,
"Land ho!"</p>

<p>Cook was over his wine and beef, in the cabin, and it
took him some time to "tumble up" on deck.</p>

<p>"Where the deuce is your land, eh?" bawls the old cruiser.</p>

<p>"Larboard beam, sir!" responds the "lookout;" and,
sure enough, a long, faint streak of land was visible from
deck. The "lookout" announced a harbor, head-lands, &amp;c.;
but the rum old captain, not being able to see any such
indication, with a chuckle, says he&mdash;</p>

<p>"You booby! harbor, eh? Ha, ha! well, we'll call it a
port, you powder monkey&mdash;<i>Port Jackson!</i>"</p>

<p>And faith, so the lookout, Jackson, became <ins title="sponser">sponsor</ins>
to the finest harbor in all Australia; for Capt. Phillip,
upon rediscovering the harbor, took his fleet into it, and
then and there began the now flourishing city of Sydney.</p>

<p>Australia is an Island, lying opposite another&mdash;New
Zealand. It is on the Indian Ocean, south side, while the
east opens to the Pacific. Australia claims to contain a
superficial area of over three million square miles, part
desert, rather mountainous, and all being in one of the
finest climates on the face of the earth. The air is dry, the
soil light and sandy; the high winds stir up the dust and
fine sand, and make ophthalmy the only positive ill peculiar
to the country. Sheep-grazing, wool-growing, and boiling
down sheep and cattle for tallow was the great business of
the country from its earliest settlement up to 1851, when
the <i>gold fever</i> swept the land.</p>

<p>Australia was inhabited by over 100,000 natives, black
cannibals of the ugliest description; but at this day not a
hundred of them remain. The natives were exceeding
stupid and useless; the first settlers, who, as Capt. Rocksalt
observes, were jail-birds and scape-gallows, were not
very dainty in dealing with the obnoxious natives; so they
determined to get rid of them as fast and easy as possible.
For this purpose, they used to gather a horde of them
together, and give them poisoned bread and rum, and so
kill them off by hundreds. It was a sharp sort of <i>practice</i>,
but the <i>ends</i> seemed to justify the <i>means</i>.</p>

<p>Gold, "laying around loose," as it did, was, no doubt,
<i>discovered</i> years ago; but not in quantities to lead the
ignorant to believe money could be made hunting it.
People may be stupid; but it requires a far greener capacity
than most of them would confess to&mdash;at least, ten years
ago&mdash;to make them believe gold could be picked up in
chunks out in the open fields.</p>

<p>But Australia began to be populated; by convicts first;
and then by far better people; though the very worst felons
sent out often became decent and respectable men, which is
indeed a great "puff," we think, for the healthfulness of
the climate. A convict shepherd now and then used to
bring into Sydney small lumps of gold and sell them to the
watch-makers, and as he refused to say where or how he got
them, it was suspicioned that he had secreted guineas or
jewelry somewhere, and occasionally melted them for sale.</p>

<p>However, one day the thing broke out, nearly simultaneously,
all over Australia. Gold was lying around everywhere.
The rocks, ledges, bars, gullies, and river-banks,
which were daily familiar to the eyes of thousands, all of a
sudden turned up bright and shining gold. Old Dame
Nature must have laughed in her sleeve to see the fun
and uproar&mdash;the scrabble and rush she had caused in her
vast household.</p>

<p>"It did beat <i>all!</i>" exclaims the old Captain. "In forty-eight
hours Sydney was half-depopulated, Port Phillip
nearly desolate, while the interior villages or towns&mdash;Bathurst,
&amp;c., were run clean out!"</p>

<p>Stores were shut up, the clerks running to the mines,
and the proprietors after the clerks. Mechanics dropped
work and put out; servants left without winking, leaving
people to wait on themselves; doctors left what few
patients they had, and bolted for the fields of Ophir; lawyers
packed up and cut stick, following their clients and victims
to the brighter fields of "causes" and effects. The newspapers
became so short-handed that dailies were knocked
into weeklies, and the weeklies into cocked hats, or something
near it&mdash;mere eight-by-ten "handbills."</p>

<p>These "discoveries" wrought as sudden as singular a
revolution in men, manners, and things. As we said before,
Australia was the very apex of singularities in the way of
Dame Nature's fancy-work, long before the gold mania
broke out; but now she seemed bent on a general and
miscellaneous freak, making the staid, matter-of-fact Englishmen
as full of caprice as the land they were living in.</p>

<p>"Only look at it!" exclaims the Captain: "the day
comes in the middle of our nights! When we're turning
in at home, they are turning out in Australia. Summer
begins in the middle of winter; and for snow storms they
get rain, thunder and lightning. About the time we are
getting used to our woollens and hot fires of the holidays,
they are roasting with heat, and going around in linen
jackets and wilted dickeys. The land is full of flowers of
every hue, gay and beautiful, gorgeous and sublime to look
at, but as senseless to the smell and as inodorous as so
many dried chips. The swans are numerous, but jet black.
The few animals in the country are all provided with
pockets in their 'overcoats,' or skin, in which to stow their
young ones, or provender. Some of the rivers really
appear," says the Captain, "to run up stream! I was
completely taken down," says the Captain, "by a bunch of
the finest pears you ever saw. Myself and a friend were up
the country, and I sees a fine pear tree, breaking down
with as elegant-looking fruit as I ever saw.</p>

<p>"'Well, by ginger,' says I, 'them are about as fine pears
as I've seen these twenty years!'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' says my friend, who was a resident in the
country; 'perhaps you would like to try a few?'</p>

<p>"'That I shall,' says I; so I ups and knocks down a
few, and it was a job to get them down, I tell you; and
when I had one between my teeth I gave it a nip&mdash;see
there, two teeth broke off," says the Captain, showing us
the fact; "the fine pears <i>were mere wood!</i></p>

<p>"The country is well supplied with fine birds; but they
are dumb as beetles, sir&mdash;never heard a bird sing or whistle
a note in Australia. The trees make no shade, the leaves
hang from the stems edge up, and look just as if they had
been whipped into shreds by a gale of wind; and you rarely
see a tree with a bit of bark on it.</p>

<p>"But what completely upset me, was the cherries, sir&mdash;fine
cherries, plenty of them, but the <i>stones were all on the
outside!</i> The bees have no stings, the snakes no fangs,
and the eagles are all white. The north wind is hot, the
south wind cold. Our longest days are in summer; but in
Australia, sir, the shortest days come in summer, and the
longest in winter; and," says the Captain, "I can't begin
to tell you how many curious didoes nature seems to cut,
in that country; but, altogether, it's one of the queerest
countries I ever did see, by ginger!"</p>

<p>And we have come to the conclusion&mdash;it is. If the gold
continues to "turn up" in such boulders and "nuggets"
as recently reported, Australia is bound to be the richest
and most densely populated, as well as <i>queerest</i> country
known to man.</p>

<h2><a name="Disquisition_on_Hinges" id="Disquisition_on_Hinges"></a>A General Disquisition on "Hinges."</h2>


<p>Did you ever see a real, true, unadulterated specimen
of <i>Down East</i>, enter a store, or other place of every-day
business, for the purpose of "looking around," or
<i>dicker</i> a little? They are "coons," they are, upon all
such occasions. We noted one of these "critters" in the
store of a friend of ours, on Blackstone Street, recently.
He was a full bloom <i>Yankee</i>&mdash;it stuck out all over him.
He sauntered into the store, as unconcerned, quietly, and
familiarly, as though in no great hurry about anything in
particular, and killing time, for his own amusement. Absalom,
Abijah, Ananias, Jedediah, or Jeremiah, or whatever
else his name may have been, wore a very large fur cap,
upon a very small and close-cut head; his features were
mightily pinched up; there was a cunning expression about
the corner of his eyes, not unlike the embodiment of&mdash;"catch
a weazel asleep!" while the smallness of his mouth,
thinness and blue cast of his chin and lips, bespoke a keen,
calculating, pinch a four-pence until it squeaked like a
frightened locomotive temperament! His "boughten" sack
coat, fitting him all over, similar to a wet shirt on a broom-handle,
was pouched out at the pockets with any quantity
of numerous articles, in the way of books and boots, pamphlets
and perfumery, knick-knacks and gim-cracks, calico,
candy, &amp;c. His vest was short, but that deficiency was
made up in superfluity of <i>dickey</i>, and a profusion of sorrel
whiskers. Having got into the store, he very leisurely
walked around, viewing the hardware, separately and
minutely, until one of the clerks edged up to him:</p>

<p>"What can we do for you to-day, sir?"</p>

<p>Looking <i>quarteringly</i> at the clerk for about two full
minutes, says he&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'd dunno, just yet, mister, what yeou kin do."</p>

<p>"Those are nice hinges, real wrought," says the clerk, referring
to an article the "customer" had just been gazing at
with evident interest.</p>

<p>"Rale wrought?" he asked, after another lapse of two minutes.</p>

<p>"They are, yes, sir," answered the clerk. Then followed
another pause; the Yankee with both his hands sunk deep
into his trowsers' pockets, and viewing the hinges at a respectful
distance, in profound calculation, three minutes full.</p>

<p>"They be, eh?" he at length responded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, <i>warranted</i>," replied the clerk. Another long
pause. The Yankee approached the hinges, two steps&mdash;picks
up a bundle of the article, looks knowingly at them
two minutes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yeou don't say so?"</p>

<p>"No doubt about that, at all," the clerk replies, rather
pertly, as he moves off to wait upon another customer, who
bought some eight or ten dollars' worth of cutlery and
tools, paid for them, and cleared out, while our Yankee
genius was still reconnoitering the hinges.</p>

<p>"I say, mister, where's them made?" inquires the Yankee.</p>

<p>"In England, sir," replied the clerk.</p>

<p>"Not in <i>Neuw</i> England, I'll bet a fo'pence!"</p>

<p>"No, not here&mdash;in Europe."</p>

<p>"I knowed they warn't made areound here, by a darn'd sight!"</p>

<p>"We've plenty of American hinges, if you wish them,"
said the clerk.</p>

<p>"I've seen <i>hinges</i> made in <i>aour</i> place, better'n them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have. We have finer hinges," answered
the clerk.</p>

<p>"I 'spect you have; I don't call <i>them</i> anything great, no how!"</p>

<p>"Well, here's a better article; better hinges&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, them's pooty nice," said the Yankee, interrupting
the clerk, "but they're small hinges."</p>

<p>"We have all sizes of them, sir, from half an inch to four inches."</p>

<p>"You hev?" inquiringly observed the Yankee, as the
clerk again left him and the hinges, to wait on another customer,
who bought a keg of nails, &amp;c., and left.</p>

<p>"I see you've got brass hinges, tew!" again continued
the Yankee, after musing to himself for twenty minutes, <i>full</i>.</p>

<p>"O, yes, plenty of them," obligingly answered the clerk.</p>

<p>"How's them brass 'uns work?"</p>

<p>"Very well, I guess; used for lighter purposes," said the clerk.</p>

<p>"Put 'em on desks, and cubber-doors, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they are used in a hundred ways."</p>

<p>"Hinges," says the Yankee, after a pause, "ain't considered,
I guess, a very neuw invenshun?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," half smilingly replied the clerk.</p>

<p>"D'yeou ever see wooden hinges, mister?"</p>

<p>"Never," candidly responded the clerk.</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>hev</i>," resolutely echoed the Yankee.</p>

<p>"You have, eh?"</p>

<p>"E' yes, plenty on 'em&mdash;eout in Illinoi; seen fellers eout
there that never seen an iron hinge or a razor in their lives!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't aware our western friends were so far behind
the times as that," said the clerk.</p>

<p>"It's a <i>fact</i>&mdash;dreadful, tew, to be eout in a place like
that," continued the Yankee. "I kept school eout there,
nigh on to a year; couldn't stand it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" mechanically echoed the poor clerk.</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir</i>; dreadful place, some parts of Illinoi; folks
air almighty green; couldn't tell how old they air, nuff on
'em; when they get mighty old and bald-headed, they stop
and die off, of their own accord."</p>

<p>"Illinois must be a healthy place?" observed the clerk.</p>

<p>"Healthy place! I guess not, mister; fever and ague
sweetens 'em, I tell you. O, it's dreadful, fever and
ague is!"</p>

<p>"That caused you to leave, I suppose?" said the clerk.</p>

<p>"Well, e' yes, partly; the climate, morals, and the water,
kind o' went agin me. The big boys had a way o' fightin',
cursin', and swearin', pitchin' apple cores and corn at the
master, that didn't exactly suit me. Finally, one day, at
last, the boys got so confeounded sassy, and I got the fever
and agy so <i>bad</i>, that they shook daown the school-house
chimney, and I shook my hair nearly all eout by the roots,
with the <i>agy</i>&mdash;so I packed up and <i>slid!</i>"</p>

<p>The clerk being again called away to wait on a fresh
customer, the Yankee was left to his meditations and survey.
Having some twenty more minutes to walk around the store,
and examine the stock, he brought up opposite the clerk,
who was busy tying up gimlets, screws, and stuff, for a
carpenter's apprentice. Yankee explodes again.</p>

<p>"Got a big steore of goods layin' areound here, haven't yeou?"</p>

<p>"We have, sir, a fair assortment," said the clerk.</p>

<p>"Them Illinoi folks haven't no <i>idee</i> what a place this
Boston is; they haven't. I tried to larn 'em a few things
towards civilization, but 'twaren't no sort o' use tryin'!"</p>

<p>"New country yet; the Illinois folks will brighten up
after a while, I guess," said the clerk. "Did you wish to
examine any other sort of hinges, sir?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Hain't I seen all yeou hev?"</p>

<p>"O, no; here we have another variety of hinges, steel,
copper, plated, &amp;c. These are fine for parlor doors, &amp;c.,"
said the clerk.</p>

<p>"E' yes them air nice, I swow, mister; look like rale
silver. I 'spect them cost somethin'?"</p>

<p>"They come rather high," said the clerk, "but we've got
them as low as you can buy them in the market."</p>

<p>"I want to know!" quietly echoes the Yankee.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; what do you wish to use them for?" says the clerk.</p>

<p>"Use 'em?" responded the Yankee.</p>

<p>"Yes; what <i>priced</i> hinges did you require?"</p>

<p>"What priced hinges?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly! Tell me what you require them <i>for</i>, and I
can soon come at the <i>sort</i> of hinges you require," said the
clerk, making an effort to come to a climax.</p>

<p>"Who said <i>I</i> wanted any hinges?"</p>

<p>"Who said you wanted any? Why, don't you want to
buy hinges?"</p>

<p>"Buy hinges? Why, <i>no;</i> I don't want nothin'; <i>I only
came in to look areound!</i>"</p>

<p>Having looked around, the imperturbable Yankee stepped
out, leaving the poor clerk&mdash;quite flabbergasted!</p>

<h2><a name="Science_of_Diddling" id="Science_of_Diddling"></a>The Science of "Diddling."</h2>


<p>Jeremy Diddlers have existed from time immemorial
down, as traces of them are found in all ancient
and modern history, from the Bible to Shakspeare, from
Shakspeare to the revelations of George Gordon Byron,
who strutted his brief hour, acted his part, and&mdash;vanished.
Diddler is derived from the word <i>diddle</i>, to <i>do</i>&mdash;every body
who has not yet made his debut to the Elephant. We believe
the word has escaped the attention of the ancient
lexicographers, and even Worcester, and the still more durable
"Webster," have no note of the word, its derivation,
or present sense.</p>

<p>A "Jeremy Diddler" is, in <i>fact</i>, one of your first-class
vagabonds; a fellow who has been spoiled by indulgent
parents, while they were in easy circumstances. Trained
up to despise labor, not capacitated by nature or inclination
to pass current in a profession, he finds himself at twenty
possessed of a genteel address, a respectable wardrobe, a
few friends, and&mdash;no visible means of support. There are
but two ways about it&mdash;take to the highway, or become a
Diddler&mdash;a sponge&mdash;and, like woodcock, live on "suction."
The early part of a Diddler's life is chiefly spent among the
ladies;&mdash;they being strongly susceptible of flattering attentions,
especially those of "a nice young man," your Diddler
lives and flourishes among them like a fighting cock. Diddler's
"heyday" being over, he next becomes a politician&mdash;an
old Hunker; attends caucusses and conventions, dinners
and inaugurations. Never aspiring to matrimony
among the ladies, he remains an "old bach;" never hoping
for office under government, he never gets any; and when,
at last, both youth and energies are wasted, Diddler dons a
white neckcloth, combs his few straggling hairs behind his
ears, and, dressed in a well-brushed but shocking seedy suit
of sable, he jines church and turns "old fogie," carries
around the plate, does chores for the parson, becomes generally
useful to the whole congregation, and finally shuffles
off his mortal coil, and ends his eventful and useless life in
the most becoming manner.</p>

<p>Cities are the only fields subservient to the successful
practice of a respectable Diddler. New York affords them
a very fair scope for operation, but of all the American
cities, New Orleans is the Diddler's paradise! The mobile
state of society, the fluctuations of men and business, the
impossibility of knowing any thing or any body there for
any considerable period, gives the Diddler ample scope for
the exercise of his peculiar abilities to great effect. He
dines almost sumptuously at the daily lunches set at the
splendid drinking saloons and <i>cafes</i>, he lives for a month at
a time on the various upward-bound steamboats. In New
Orleans, the departure of a steamer for St. Louis, Cincinnati
or Pittsburg, is announced for such an hour "to-day"&mdash;positively;
Diddler knows it's "all a gag" to get passengers
and baggage hurried on, and the steamer keeps
<i>going</i> for two to five days before she's gone; so he comes
on board, registers one of his commonplace aliases, gets
his state-room and board among the crowd of <i>real</i> passengers,
up to the hour of the boat's shoving out, then he&mdash;slips
ashore, and points his boots to another boat. Many's

<h2><a name="Thanksgiving_Story" id="Thanksgiving_Story"></a>The Re-Union; Thanksgiving Story.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Behold, for peace I had great bitterness, but thou hast in love to my
soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins
behind thy back."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah.</span></p></div>


<p>A portly elderly gentleman, with one hand in his
breeches pocket, and the fingers of the other drumming
a disconsolate rub-a-dub upon the window glass of an
elegant mansion near Boston Common, is the personage
I wish to call your attention to, friend reader, for the space
of a few moments. The facts of my story are commonplace,
and thereby the more probable. The names of the
dramatis personæ I shall introduce, will be the <i>only</i> part of
my subject imaginary. Therefore, the above-described old
gentleman, whom we found and left drumming his rub-a-dub
upon the window panes, we shall call Mr. Joel Newschool.
To elucidate the matter more clearly, I would beg leave to
say, that Mr. Joel Newschool, though now a wealthy and
retired merchant, with all the "pomp and circumstance" of
fortune around him, could&mdash;if he chose&mdash;well recollect the
day when his little feet were shoeless, red and frost-bitten,
as he plodded through the wheat and rye stubble of a Massachusetts
farmer, for whom he acted in early life the trifling
character of a "cow boy."</p>

<p>Yes, Joel could remember this if he chose; but to the
vain heart of a proud millionaire, such reflections seldom
come to the surface. Like hundreds of other instances in
the history of our countrymen, by a prolonged life of enterprise
and good luck, Joel Newschool found himself, at
the age of four-and-sixty, a very wealthy, if not a happy
man. With his growing wealth, grew up around him a
large family. Having served an apprenticeship to farming,
he allowed but a brief space to elapse between his freedom
suit and portion, and his wedding-day. Joel and his young
and fresh country spouse, with light hearts and lighter
purses, came to Boston, settled, and thus we find them old
and wealthy. In the heart and manners of Mrs. Newschool,
fortune made but slight alteration; but the accumulation
of dollars and exalted privileges that follow wealth, had
wrought many changes in the heart and feelings of her husband.</p>

<p>The wear of time, which is supposed to dim the eye,
seemed to improve the ocular views of Joel Newschool
amazingly, for he had been enabled in his late years to see
that a vast difference of <i>caste</i> existed between those that
tilled the soil, wielded the sledge hammer, or drove the
jack-plane, and those that were merely the idle spectators
of such operations. He no longer groped in the darkness
of men who believed in such fallacies as that wealth gave
man no superiority over honest poverty! In short, Mr.
Newschool had kept pace with all the fine notions and ostentatious
feelings so peculiar to the mushroom aristocracy
of the nineteenth century. He gloried in his pride, and yet
felt little or none of that happiness that the bare-footed,
merry cow boy enjoyed in the stubble field. But such is man.</p>

<p>With all his comfortable appurtenances wealth could buy
and station claim, the retired merchant was not a happy
man. Though his expensive carriage and liveried driver
were seen to roll him regularly to the majestic church upon
the Sabbath: though he was a patient listener to the massive
organ's spiritual strains and the surpliced minister's
devout incantations: though he defrauded no man, defamed
not his neighbor, was seeming virtuous and happy, there
was at his heart a pang that turned to lees the essence of
his life.</p>

<p>Joel Newschool had seen his two sons and three daughters,
men and women around him; they all married and left
his roof for their own. One, a favorite child, a daughter,
a fine, well-grown girl, upon whom the father's heart had
set its fondest seal&mdash;she it was that the hand of Providence
ordained to humble the proud heart of the sordid millionaire.
Cecelia Newschool, actuated by the noblest impulses
of nature, had for her husband sought "a <i>man</i>, not a money
chest," and this circumstance had made Cecelia a severed
member of the Newschool family, who could not, in
the refined delicacy of their senses, tolerate such palpable
condescension as to acknowledge a tie that bound <i>them</i> to
the wife of a poor artizan, whatever might be his talents or
integrity as a man.</p>

<p>Francis Fairway had made honorable appeal to the heart
of Cecelia, and she repaid his pains with the full gift of a
happy wife. She counted not his worldly prospects, but
yielded all to his constancy. She wished for nothing but
his love, and with that blessed beacon of life before her,
she looked but with joy and hope to the bright side of the
sunny future.</p>

<p>The home of the artizan was a plain, but a happy one.
Loving and beloved, Cecelia scarce felt the loss of her sumptuous
home and ties of kindred. But not so the proud
father and the patient mother, the haughty sisters and brothers;
they felt all; they attempted to conceal all, that bitterness
of soul, the canker that gnaws upon the heart when
we will strive to stifle the better parts of our natures.</p>

<p>Time passed on; one, two, or three years, are quickly
passed and gone. Though this little space of time made
little or no change in the families of the proud and indolent
relatives, it brought many changes in the eventful life of
the young artizan and his wife. Two sweet little babes
nestled in the mother's arms, and a new and splendid invention
of the poor mechanic was reaping the wonder and
admiration of all Europe and America.</p>

<p>This was salt cast upon the affected wounds of the
haughty relatives. Now ashamed of their petty, poor,
contemptible arrogance, they could not in their hearts find
space to welcome or partake of the proud dignity with
which honorable industry had crowned the labors of the
young mechanic.</p>

<p>It was a cold day in November; the wind was twirling
and whistling through the trees on the Common; the dead
leaves were dropping seared and yellow to the earth, admonishing
the old gentleman whom we left drumming upon
the window, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Such was life!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The old gentleman thumped and thumped the window
pane with a dreary <i>sotto voce</i> accompaniment for some minutes,
when he was interrupted by an aged, pious-looking
matron, who dropped her spectacles across the book in her
lap, as she sat in her chair by the fireside, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Joel."</p>

<p>"Umph?" responded the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"The Lord has spared us to see another Thanksgiving
day, should we live to see to-morrow."</p>

<p>"He has," responded Mr. Newschool.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, Joel, that how ungrateful to God
we are, for the blessings, and prosperity, and long life
vouchsafed to us, by a good and benevolent Almighty."</p>

<p>"Rebecca," said the faltering voice of the rich man, "I
know, I feel all this as sensitive as you can possibly feel it."</p>

<p>"I was thinking, Joel," continued the good woman, "to-morrow
we shall, God permitting, be with our children and
friends once again, together."</p>

<p>"I hope so, I trust we shall," answered the husband.</p>

<p>"And I was thinking, Joel," resumed the wife, "that the
exclusion of our own child, Cecelia, from the family
re-unions, from joining us in returning thanks to God for his
mercy and preservation of us, is cruel and offensive to Him
we deign to render up our prayers."</p>

<p>"Rebecca," said the old gentleman, "I but agree with
you in this, you have but anticipated my feelings in the matter.
I have long fought against my better feelings and
offended a discriminating God, I know. Ashamed to confess
my stubbornness and frailty before, I now freely confess
an altered feeling and better determination."</p>

<p>"Then, Joel, let our daughter Cecelia and her husband
join with us to-morrow in rendering our thanks to a just
God and kind Providence."</p>

<p>"Be it so, Rebecca. God truly knows it will be a millstone
relieved from my heart. I wish it done."</p>

<p>Three family re-unions, three days of Thanksgiving had
been held in the paternal mansion of the Newschools, since
Cecelia had left it for the humble home of the poor artizan.
But their several re-unions were clouded, gloomy, unsocial
affairs; there was a gap in the social circle of the Newschool
family, as they met on Thanksgiving day, which all
felt, but none hinted at. It was hard for a parent to invoke
blessings on a portion, but not all, of his own flesh and
blood; it was hard to return thanks for those dear ones present,
and <i>wonder</i> whether the absent and equally dear had
aught to be thankful for, whether instead of health and
comfort, they might not be sorrowing in disease, poverty,
and despair! Such things as these, when they obtrude
upon the mind, the soul, are not likely to make merry meetings.
And such was the position and nature of the re-union
upon the late Thanksgiving days, at the Newschool mansion.
But better feelings were at work, and a happy change
was at hand.</p>

<p>Several carriages had already drove up to the door of
Mr. Newschool, Sen., and let down the different branches
of the Newschool family. A brighter appearance seemed
gathering over the household than was usual of late on
Thanksgiving day, in the old family mansion. As each party
came, the good old mother duly informed them of the invitation
given, and the hope indulged in, that Cecelia and
her husband would join the family circle that day, in their re-union.</p>

<p>The proud sisters seemed willing, at last, to cast away
their pride, and greet their sister as became Christian and
sensible women. The brothers, chagrined at the unmanliness
of their conduct, now gladly joined their approval of
what betokened, in fact, a happy family meeting. As the
clock on old South Church tower pealed out eleven, a
pretty, smiling young mother, in plain, but unexceptionable,
neat attire, ascended the large stone steps of the Newschool
mansion, with a light and graceful step, bearing a sleeping
child in her arms.</p>

<p>Another moment, and Cecelia Fairway was in the arms
of her old mother; the smiles, kisses and tears of the whole
family party were bountifully showered upon poor Cecelia,
and her sweet little daughter. Imagination may always
better paint such a scene, than could the feeble pen describe
it. The deep and gushing eloquence of human nature,
when thus long pent, bursts forth, sweeping the meagre devises
of the pen before it, like snow-flakes before the mighty
mountain avalanche.</p>

<p>Oh! it was a happy sight, to see that party at their
Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Newschool, in his long and fervent prayer to
the throne of grace, expressed the day the happiest one of
his long life. Quickly flew the hours by, and as the shades
of evening gathered around, Francis Fairway was announced
with a carriage for his wife's return home. Francis Fairway,
the artizan, was a proud, high-minded man, conscious
of his own position and merits, and scorned any base
means to conciliate the favor and patronage of his superiors
in rank, birth, or education. His deportment to the
Newschool family was frank and manly; and they met it
with a sense of just appreciation and dignity, that did
them honor. Francis met a generous welcome, and the
evening of Thanksgiving day was spent in a happy re-union
indeed. Upon Cecelia's and her husband's return home,
she found a small note thrust in the bosom of her child,
bearing this inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Grandfather's Re-union gift to little Cecelia; Boston, Nov., 184-."</p></div>

<p>The note contained five $1000 bills on the old Granite
Bank of Boston, and which were duly placed in the old
Bank fire-proof, to the account of the little heir, the enterprise
of the artizan having placed him above the necessity
of otherwise disposing of Joel Newschool's gift to the grandchild.</p>

<h2><a name="from_the_Country" id="from_the_Country"></a>Wanted&mdash;A Young Man from the Country.</h2>


<p>All of our mercantile cities are overrun with young
men who have been bred for the counter or desk, and
thousands of these genteel young gents find it any thing
but an easy matter to find bread or situations half their
time, in these crowded marts of men and merchandise. An
advertisement in a New York or New Orleans paper, for a
clerk or salesman, rarely fails to "turn up" a hundred
needy and greedy applicants, in the course of a morning!
In New York, where a vast number of these misguided
young men are "manufactured," and continue to be manufactured
by the regiment, for an already surfeited market,
there are wretches who practise upon these innocent victims
of perverted usefulness, a species of fraud but slightly understood.</p>

<p>By a confederacy with some experienced dry goods
dealer, the proprietor of one of those agencies for procuring
situations for young men, <i>victims</i> of misplaced confidence
are put through at five to ten dollars each, somewhat after
this fashion: Sharp, the keeper of the Agency, advertises
for two good clerks, one book-keeper, five salesmen, ten
waiters, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and, of course, as every steamboat, car
and stage, running into New York, brings in a fresh importation
of young men from the country, all fitted out in
the knowledge box for salesmen, book-keepers and clerk-ships,&mdash;every
morning, a new set are offered to be taken
in and done for. Sharp demands a fee of five or ten dollars
for obtaining a situation; victim forks over the amount,
and is sent to Sharp number two, who keeps the dry goods
shop; he has got through with a victim of yesterday, and
is now ready for the fresh victim of to-day; for he makes
it a point to put them through such a gamut of labor, vexatious
man&oelig;uvres and insolence, that not one out of fifty
come back next day, and if they do&mdash;<i>he don't want them!</i>
If the unsuspecting victim returns to the "Agency," he is
lectured roundly for his incapacity or want of <i>energy!</i>&mdash;and
advised to return to the country and recuperate.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Bumps having graduated with all the honors of
Sniffensville Academy, and having many unmistakable
longings for becoming a Merchant Prince, and seeing sights
in a city; and having read an account of the great fortunes
piled up in course of a few years, by poor, friendless country
boys, like Abbot Lawrence, John Jacob Astor, he up and
came right straight to Boston, having read it in the papers
that clerks, salesmen, book-keepers, and so on, were wanted,
dreadfully&mdash;"young men from the country preferred"&mdash;so
he called on the <i>suffering</i> agent for the public, and paying
down his <i>fee</i>, was sent off to an <i>Importing House</i>, on &mdash;&mdash;
street, where a clerk and salesman were wanted. Jeremiah
found his idea of an <i>Importing House</i> knocked into a disarranged
chapeau, by finding the one in the "present case,"
a large and luminous <i>store</i>, filled up with paper boxes and
sham bundles; while gaudily festooned, were any quantity
of calicoes, cheap shawls, ribbons, tapes, and innumerable
other tuppenny affairs.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar Cheatum, the proprietor of this importing
and jobbing house, was a keen, little, slick-as-a-whistle,
heavy-bearded, shaved and starched genus, of six-and-thirty,
more or less; and received Jeremiah with a rather patronizing
survey <i>personelle</i>, and opened the engagement with a
few remarks.</p>

<p>"From the country, are you?"</p>

<p>"Sniffensville, sir," said Jeremiah; "County of Scrub-oak,
State of New Hampshire."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I prefer country-bred young men; they are
better trained," said Cheatum, "to industry, perseverance,
honest frugality, and the duties of a Christian man. I was
brought up in the country myself. I've made myself;
carved out, and built up my own position, sir. Yes, sir,
give me good, sound, country-bred young men; I've tried
them, I know what they are," said Cheatum; and he spoke
near enough the truth to be partly true, for he <i>had</i> "tried
them;" he averaged some fifty-two clerks and an equal
number of <i>salesmen</i>&mdash;yearly.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Bumps grew red in the face at the complimentary
manner in which Nebuchadnezzar Cheatum was
pleased to review the country and its institutions.</p>

<p>"What salary did you think of allowing?" says Jeremiah.</p>

<p>"Well," said Cheatum, "I allow my salesmen three
dollars a week the first year, (Jeremiah's ears cocked up,)
and three per cent. on the sales they make the second year."</p>

<p>By cyphering it up "in his head," Jeremiah came to the
conclusion that the <i>first</i> year wouldn't add much to his
pecuniary elevation, whatever the second did with its three
per cents. But he was bound to try it on, anyhow.</p>

<p>"Now," said Cheatum, "in the first place, Solomon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jeremiah, if you please, sir," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Thomas&mdash;<i>pshaw!</i>&mdash;Jediah, I would say," continued
Cheatum, correcting himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jeremiah&mdash;Jeremiah Bumps, sir," sharply echoed Mr. Bumps.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes; one has so many clerks and salesmen in
course of business," said Cheatum, "that I get their names
confused. Well, Jeremiah, in the first place, you must
learn to please the customers; you must always be lively
and spry, and never give an offensive answer. Many women
and girls come in to price and overhaul things, without the
remotest idea of buying anything, and it's often trying to
one's patience; but you must wait on them, for there is no
possible means of telling a woman who <i>shops</i> for pastime,
from one who shops in earnest; so you must be careful, be
polite, be lively and spry, and never let a person <i>go</i> without
making a purchase, if you can possibly help it. If a person
asks for an article we have not got, endeavor to make them
try something else. If a woman asks whether four-penny
calico, or six-penny delaines will wash, say 'yes, ma'am,
<i>beautifully</i>; I've tried them, or seen them tried;' and if
they say, 'are these ten cent flannels real <i>Shaker flannels</i>?
or the ninepence hose <i>all merino</i>?' better not contradict
them; say 'yes, ma'am, I've tried them, seen them tried,
know they are,' or similar appropriate answers to the
various questions that may be asked," said Cheatum.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Jeremiah responded, "I understand."</p>

<p>"And, William&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jeremiah, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; well, Jediah&mdash;Jeremiah, I would say&mdash;when
you make change, never take a ten cent piece and two cents
for a shilling, but give it as often as practicable; look out
for the fractions in adding up, and beware of crossed six-pences,
smooth shillings, and what are called Bungtown
coppers," said Cheatum, with much emphasis.</p>

<p>"I'm pooty well posted up, sir, in all <i>that</i>," said Jeremiah.</p>

<p>"And, Jeems&mdash;pshaw!&mdash;Jacob&mdash;Jeremiah! I would say,
in measuring, always put your thumb <i>so</i>, and when you
move the yardstick forward, shove your thumb an inch or
so <i>back</i>; in measuring <i>close</i> you may manage to squeeze
out five yards from four and three-quarters, you understand?
And always be watchful that some of those nimble, light-fingered
folks don't slip a roll of ribbon, or a pair of gloves
or hose, or a piece of goods, up their sleeves, in their
bosoms, pockets, or under their shawls. Be careful, Henry&mdash;Jeems,
I should say," said Cheatum.</p>

<p>Being duly rehearsed, Jeremiah Bumps went to work.
The first customer he had was a little girl, who bought a
yard of ribbon for ninepence, and Jeremiah not only
stretched seven-eighths of a yard into a full yard, but made
twelve cents go for a ninepence, which <i>feat</i> brought down
the vials of wrath of the child's mother, a burly old Scotch
woman, who "tongue-lashed" poor Jeremiah awfully! His
next adventure was the sale of a dress pattern of sixpenny
de-laine, which he <i>warranted</i> to contain all the perfections
known to the best article, and in dashing his vigorous scissors
through the fabric, he caught them in the folds of a
dozen silk handkerchiefs on the counter, and ripped them
all into slitters! The young woman who took the dress
pattern, upon reaching home, found it contained but eight
yards, when she paid for nine. She came back, and Jeremiah
Bumps got another bombasting! He sold fourpenny
calico, and warranted it to wash; next day it came back,
and an old lady with it; the colors and starch were all out,
by dipping it in water, and the woman went on so that Cheatum
was glad to refund her money to get rid of her. Two
dashing young ladies, out "shopping" for their own
diversions, gave Jeremiah a call; he labored hand and
tongue, he hauled down and exhibited Cheatum's entire
stock; the girls then were leaving, saying they would "call
again," and Jeremiah very amiably said, "do, ladies, do;
call again, <i>like to secure your custom!</i>" The young ladies
took this as an insult. Their big brothers waited on Mr.
Bumps, and nothing short of his humble apologies saved
him from enraged cowhides! Jeremiah saw a suspicious
woman enter the store, and after overhauling a box of
gloves, he thought he saw her <i>pocket a pair</i>. He intercepted
the lady as she was going out&mdash;he grabbed her by
the pocket&mdash;the lady resisted&mdash;Jeremiah held on&mdash;the lady
fainted, and Jeremiah Bumps nearly tore her dress off in
pulling out the gloves! The lady proved to be the wife of
a distinguished citizen, and the gloves purchased at another
store! A lawsuit followed, and Mr. Bumps was fined $100,
and sent to the House of Correction for sixty days.</p>

<p>How many new clerks Nebuchadnezzar Cheatum has put
through since, we know not; but Jeremiah Bumps is now
engaged in the practical science of agriculture, and shudders
at the idea of a young man from the country being
<i>wanted</i> in a dry goods shop, if they have got to see the
elephant that he <i>observed&mdash;in Boston</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport&mdash;the "Ned Davenport" of the Bowery

<h2><a name="The_Skippers_Schooner" id="The_Skippers_Schooner"></a>The Skipper's Schooner.</h2>


<p>No better specimen of the genus, genuine Yankee nation,
can be found, imagined or described, than the
skippers of along shore, from Connecticut river to Eastport,
Maine. These critters give full scope to the Hills and
Hacketts of the stage, and the Sam Slicks and Falconbridges
of the press, to embody and sketch out in the
broadest possible dialect of Yankee land. One of these
"tarnal critters," it is my purpose to draw on for my brief
sketch, and I wish my readers to do me the credit to believe
that for little or no portion of my yarn or language am I
indebted to fertility of imagination, as the incidents are
real, and quite graphic enough to give piquancy to the subject.</p>

<p>Last spring, just after the breaking up of winter, a down-east
smack or schooner, freighted with cod-fish and potatoes,
I believe, rounded off Cape Ann light, and owing to
head winds, or some other perversity of a nautical nature,
could no further go; so the skipper and his crew&mdash;one
man, green as catnip&mdash;made for an anchorage, and hove
the "hull consarn" to. Here they lay, and tossed and
chafed, at their moorings, for a day or two, without the
slightest indication on the part of the weather to abate the
nuisance. So the commander of the schooner got in his
little "dug-out," and giving the aforesaid crew special injunctions
to keep all fast, he pulled off to shore to take
a look around.</p>

<p>Now, it so fell out that in the course of a few hours' time
after the departure of the skipper, a snorting east wind
sprang up, and not only blew great guns, but chopped up
a short, heavy sea, perfectly astonishing and alarming to
Hezekiah Perkins, in the rolling and pitching schooner. It
was Hez's first attempt at seafaring; and this sort of reeling
and waltzing about, as a matter of course, soon discomboberated
his bean basket, and set his head in a whirl and
dancing motion&mdash;better conceived by those who have seen
the sea elephant than described. Hez got dea-a-athly sick,
so sick he could not budge from the stern sheets, where he
had taken a squat in the early commencement of his difficulties.
In the mean time, the skipper came down to the
beach and hailed the victim:</p>

<p>"Hel-<span class="smcap">lo</span>! hel-<span class="smcap">lo</span>!"</p>

<p>Hez feebly elevated his optics, and looking to the windward,
where stood his noble captain, he made an effort to
say over something:</p>

<p>"Wha-a-t ye-e-e want?"</p>

<p>"What do I want? Why, yeou pesky critter, yeou, go
for'ard thar and hist the jib, take up the anchor, put your
helm a-lee, and beat up to town!"</p>

<p>This was all very well, provided the skipper was there
to superintend, manage and carry out his voluble orders;
but as the surf prevented him from coming on board, and
the lightness of Hez's head militated against the almost
superhuman possibility of carrying out the skipper's orders,
things remained <i>in statu quo</i>, the skipper ashore, and Hez
fervently wishing he was too.</p>

<p>"Ain't you a-going to stir round there, and save the vessel?"
bawled the excited captain.</p>

<p>"How on airth," groaned the horror-stricken mariner,
"how on airth am I to help it?"</p>

<p>"Wall, by Columbus, she'll go clean ashore, or blow
eout to sea afore long, sure as death!" responded the skipper;
and before he had fairly concluded his augury, sure
enough, the halser parted, the schooner slew round and
made a bee-line <i>for Cowes and a market!</i> This rather
brought Hezekiah to his oats&mdash;he riz, tottering and feeble,
on his shaky pins, and crawled forward to get up the jib.</p>

<p>"O ye-s, now yeou're coming about it, yes, yeou be,"
bawled the almost frantic skipper, as the distance between
him and his vessel was increasing. "Put her abeout and
head her up the ba-a-y!" But it was no kind of use in
talking, for Hezekiah could not raise the jib; and his imperfect
nautical knowledge, under such a snarl, completely
bewildered and disgusted him with the prospect. So saying
over the seven commandments and other serious lessons
of youth, Hezekiah resigned himself to the tumultuous elements,
and concluded it philosophical and scriptural resignation
to let Providence and the old schooner fix out the
programme just as they might. It is commonly reported,
that our mackerel catchers, when a storm or gale overtakes
them on the briny deep, lash all fast and go below, turn in
and let their smacks rip along to the best of their knowledge
and ability. They seldom founder or get severely
scathed; and these facts, or perfect indifference, having entered
the head of Hezekiah Perkins, he became perfectly
unconcerned as to future developments. Night coming on,
the skipper saw his schooner fast departing out to sea, and
when she was no longer to be seen, he made tracks for Boston,
to report the melancholy facts to the owners of the
vessel and cargo, and see about the insurance.</p>

<p>Next morning, the skipper having discovered that the
insurance was safe, he found himself in better spirits; so
he walked down along the wharves, to take a look out upon
the bay and shipping&mdash;when lo, and behold, he sees a vessel
so amazingly like his Two Pollies, that he could not
refrain from exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! hurrah! By Christopher Columbus&mdash;if thar
don't come my old beauty and Hez Perkins, too&mdash;hurrah!"</p>

<p>The overjoyed skipper went off into a double hornpipe
on a single string; and as the veritable schooner came
booming saucily up the bay before a spanking breeze, with
her jib spread, the skipper called out in a voice of thunder
and gladness:</p>

<p>"Hel-lo! Hez Perkins, is that yeou?"</p>

<p>"Hel-lo! Cap'n, I'm coming, by pumpkins! Clear the
track for the Two Pollies!" And putting her head in
among the smacks of Long Wharf, Hez let her rip and
smash chock up fast and tight. When the captain landed
on his own deck, he rushed into the arms of his brave mate
Hezekiah, and they had a regular fraternal hug all round&mdash;and
Hezekiah Perkins, in behalf of his wonderful skill,
perseverance and luck, was unanimously voted first mate
of the Two Pollies on the spot. It appeared that a change
of wind during the night had driven the wandering vessel
back into the bay, and Hezekiah, having got over his sick
spell by daylight, crawled forward, got up the jib, and actually
made the wharf, as we have described.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The pen is mightier than the sword."</p></div>


<p>Great men are not the less liable or addicted to very
small, and very mean, and sometimes very <i>rascally
acts</i>, but they are always fortunate in having any amount
of panegyric graven on marble slabs, shafts and pillars, o'er
their dust, and eulogistic and profound histories written in
memories of the deeds of renown and glory they have executed.
An American 74-gun ship would hardly float the
mountains of <i>tomes</i> written upon Bonaparte and his brilliant
career, as a soldier and a conqueror; but how precious
few, insignificant pages do we ever see of the misdeeds,
tyrannies and acts of petty and contemptuous meanness so
great a man was guilty of! Why should authors and orators
be so reluctant to tell the truth of a great man's follies
and crimes, seeing with what convenience and fluency
they will <i>lie</i> for him? We contend, and shall contend, that
a truly great man cannot be guilty of a small act, and that
one contemptible or atrocious manifestation in man, is
enough to sully&mdash;tarnish the brightness of a dozen brilliant
deeds; but apparently, the accepted notion is&mdash;<i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>In 1830, there lived in the city of Philadelphia, a barber,
a poor, harmless, necessary barber. His antique, or
most curious costume, attracted much attention about the
vicinity in which he lived, and no doubt added somewhat
to the custom of his shop, itself a <i>bijou</i> as curious almost
as the proprietor. But as our story has but little to do
with the queer outside of the <i>barber</i> or his <i>shop</i>, and we do
not now purpose a whole history of the man, we shall at
once proceed to the pith of our subject&mdash;the Emperor and
the poor Author, or Napoleon and his Spies&mdash;and in
which our aforesaid Philadelphia barber plays a conspicuous part.</p>

<p>Some of the writers, a few of those partially daring
enough to give an impartial <i>expose</i> of the history of the
Bonapartean times, seem to think that Napoleon committed
a great error in his accession to the throne, by doubting
the stability of his reign, and having pursued exactly measures
antipodean to those necessary to seat him firmly in the
hearts of the people, and cement the foundation of his
newly-acquired power. But we don't think so; the means
by which he obtained the giddy height, to a comprehensive
mind like his, at once suggested the necessity of vigilance,
promptness, and unflinching execution of whatever act,
however tyrannous or heartless it might have been, his unsleeping
mind suggested&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Crowns got with blood, by blood must be maintained."</p></div>

<p>Jealous and suspicious, he sought to shackle public opinion&mdash;the
fearful hydra to all ambitious aspirants&mdash;to know
all <i>secrets</i> of the time and states, and render one half of the
great nations he held in his grasp spies upon the other!
The most profligate principles of Machiavel sink into
obscurity when contrasted with the Imperial <i>Espionage</i> of
Napoleon. When no longer moving squadrons in the
tented field&mdash;whole armies, like so many pieces of chess in
the hands of a dexterous player&mdash;he sat upon his throne,
reclined upon his lounge or smoked in his bath, organized
and moved the most difficult and dangerous forces in the
world&mdash;<i>an army of Spies!</i></p>

<p>All ages, from that of infancy to decrepitude&mdash;all conditions
of life, from peer to parvenu&mdash;from plough to the
anvil&mdash;pulpit to the bar&mdash;orators and beggars, soldiers and
sailors, male and female of every grade&mdash;men of the most
insinuating address, and women of the most seductive ages
and loveliness, grace and beauty were enlisted and trained
to serve&mdash;in what the pot-bellied, bald-headed little monster
of war used to call his <i>Cytherian Cohort!</i> Snares set
by these imperial policemen were difficult to avoid, from the
almost utter impossibility of suspicioning their presence or power.</p>

<p>In 1808, a learned Italian, noble by birth, in consequence
of the movements and <i>executions</i> of Napoleon, found it
prudent to shave off his moustache and titles, and change
the scene of his future life, as well as change his name. A
master of languages and a man of mind, he sought the
learned precincts of Leipsic, Germany, where he preserved
his incognito, though he was not long in winning the grace,
and other considerations due enlarged intellect, from those
not lacking that invaluable commodity themselves. Herr
Beethoven&mdash;the new title of our Italian "mi lord"&mdash;conceived
the project of convincing the mighty Emperor&mdash;the
hero of the sword&mdash;that so little a javelin as the pen could
puncture the <i>sac</i> containing all <i>his</i> great pretensions, and
let the vapor out; in short, to show the conqueror, that the
pen <i>was</i> mightier than his magic sword. Beethoven purposed
writing a pamphlet <i>memorial</i>, involving the bombastic
pretensions, the gigantic extravagance and arrogant
ambition of Bonaparte. The man of letters well knew the
ground upon which he was to tread, the danger of ambushed
foes, involving such a <i>brochure</i>, and the caution
necessary with which he was to produce his work. But
Beethoven felt the necessity of the production; he possessed
the power to execute a great benefit to his fellow
man, and he determined to wield it and take the chances.
Though scarcely giving breath to his project&mdash;guarding
each page of his writing as vigilantly as though they were
each blessed with the enchantment of a <i>Koh-i-Noor</i>&mdash;a
mysterious agency discovered the fact&mdash;Napoleon shook in
his royal boots, and swore in good round French, when the
following missive reached his royal eye:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Sire(!)</i>&mdash;A plot is brewing against your peace; the
safety of your throne is menaced by a villainous scribe. My
informant, who has read the manuscripts, informs me that
he has never seen any thing better or more imposing, and
ingenious in argument and force, than the fellow's appeal to
all the crowned heads and people of Europe. It is calculated
to carry an irresistible conviction of the wrongs they
suffer from your imperial majesty to every breast. These
manuscripts are fraught with more danger to your Imperial
Majesty's Empire, than all the hostile bayonets in the world
combined against you, Sire.</p>

<p>Leipsic, 1808. <span class="smcap">Baron De</span>&mdash;&mdash;.</p></div>

<p>Here was a hot shot dangling over the magazines of the
mighty man, and the "little corporal" jumped into his
boots, and began to set the wheels of his great "expediency"
in motion. A message flew here, and another
there; a dispatch to this one, and a royal order to that one.
A dozen secretaries, and a score of <i>amanuensises</i> were instantly
at work, and the alarmed "Emperor of all the
French" fairly beat the <i>reveille</i> upon his diamond-cased
snuff box; while, with the rapidity of the clapper of an
alarm bell, he issued to each the oral order to which they
were to lend enchantment by their rapid quills.</p>

<p>Herr Beethoven was surprised in his very closet! Papers
were found scattered all over his little sanctum&mdash;the spies
had him and his effects, most promptly; but what was the
rage and disappointment of the emissaries of the wily
monarch, to find neither hair nor hide of the dreaded <i>fiat!</i>
Had it gone forth? Was it secreted? Was it written?</p>

<p>They had the <i>man</i>, but his flesh and blood were as valueless
as a pebble to a diamond, contrasted with the witchery
of the <i>words</i> he had invested a few sheets of simple paper
with! They searched his clothes&mdash;tore up his bed, broke
up his furniture, powdered his few pieces of statuary, but
all in vain&mdash;the sought for, dreaded, and hated documents,
for which his <i>Imperial highness</i> would have secretly given
ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;fifty thousand <i>louis</i>&mdash;was not to be found!
The rage of the inquisitors was terrific&mdash;showing how
well they were chosen or paid, to serve in their atrocious
capacities. The poor scribe was promised all manner of unpleasant
<i>finales</i>, cursed, menaced, and finally coaxed.</p>

<p>"I have written nothing&mdash;published nothing, nor do I
intend to write or publish anything," was Beethoven's reply.</p>

<p>"Speak fearlessly," said the chief of the inquisitors,
"and rely upon a generous monarch's benevolence. My
commission, sir, is limited to ascertain whether poverty has
not compelled you to write; if that be the case, speak out;
place any price upon your work&mdash;the price is nothing&mdash;I
will pay you at once and destroy your documents."</p>

<p>"Your offers, sir," responded the poor author, "are
most kind and liberal, and I regret extremely that it is <i>not</i>
in my power to avail myself of them. I again declare, sir,
that I have never written anything against the French government&mdash;your
information to the contrary is false and wicked."</p>

<p>The spies, finding they could not gain any information of
the author, by threat or bribe, carried him to France, where
his doom was supposed to be sealed in torture and death,
in the <i>Bastile</i> of the Emperor.</p>

<p>But where was this fearful manuscript&mdash;this dreaded
scribbling of the God-forsaken, poor, forlorn author? The
emissaries of his serene highness had the blood, bones, and
body of the wretched scribe, but where was that they feared
more than all the warlike forces of a million of the best
equipped forces of Europe&mdash;the paltry paper pellets of a
scholar's brain&mdash;the <i>memorial</i> to the crowned heads, and
people of the several shivering monarchies of continental Europe?</p>

<p>A few brief hours&mdash;not two days&mdash;before the <i>pseudo</i>
Herr Beethoven was honored by the special considerations
and attentions of the Emperor of all the French&mdash;the conqueror
of a third, at least, of the civilized world&mdash;he had
conceived suspicions of a man to whom in the <i>most profound
confidence</i> he had revealed a slight whisper of his projects&mdash;impressed
with the foreshadowing that a mysterious
<i>something</i> dangerous was about to menace him, he made
way with the manuscripts, to which his soul clung as too
dear and precious to be destroyed&mdash;he gave them to the
charge of a tried friend&mdash;and before the <i>Cytherian Cohort</i>
were upon the threshold of the author, his <i>memorial</i> was
snugly ensconced in the obscure and remote secretary of a
gentleman and a man of letters, in the renowned city of
Prague. The alarm and friend's appearance seemed most
opportune&mdash;for an hour after the visitation of the one, the
other was at hand&mdash;the documents transferred and on their
way to their place of refuge.</p>

<p>But difficult was the stepping-stone to Napoleon's greatness&mdash;the
more the mystery of the manuscripts augmented&mdash;the
more enthusiastic became his research&mdash;the more formidable
appeared the necessity of grasping them; and the
determination, at all hazards, to clutch them, before they
served their purpose!</p>

<p>"Bring me the manuscripts"&mdash;was the <i>fiat</i> of the Emperor:
"I care not <i>how</i> you obtain them&mdash;get them, <i>bring
them here</i>; and mark you, let neither money, danger nor fatigue,
oppose my will. Hence&mdash;bring the manuscripts!"</p>

<p>Again Leipsic was invested by the <i>Cytherian Cohort</i> of
the modern Alexander; the rival of Hannibal, the great
little commandant of the most warlike nation of the earth.
The Baron &mdash;&mdash;, who was master of ceremonies in this
great enterprise, now arrested the secret agent who had
given the information of the existence of the <i>memorial</i>. This
wretch had received five hundred crowns for his espionage
and treachery. His fee was to be quadrupled if his atrocious
information proved correct; so dear is the mere foreshadowing
of ill news to vaunting ambition and quaking
imposters. Bengert, the German spy, was sure of the genuineness
of his information&mdash;he was much astonished that
the Baron had not seized the <i>memorial</i>, as well as the body
of the hapless author. The Baron and the treacherous
German conferred at length; an idea seemed to strike the spy.</p>

<p>"I have it," he exclaimed, a few days before his arrest.
"I saw a friend visit Beethoven; I know they both entertained
the same sentiments in regard to the Emperor&mdash;<i>that
man has the manuscripts</i>."</p>

<p>Where was that man? It was finding the needle in the
hay stack&mdash;<i>the</i> pebble in the brook. Again the Emperor
urged, and the <i>Cytherian Cohort</i> plied their cunning and
perseverance. That <i>friend</i> of the poor author was found&mdash;he
was tilling his garden, surrounded by his flower pots and
children, on the outskirts of Prague, Bohemia. It was in
vain he questioned his captors. He dropped his gardening
implements&mdash;blessed his children&mdash;kissed them, and was
hurried off, he knew not whither or wherefore! Shaubert was
this man's name; he was forty, a widower&mdash;a scholar, a
poet&mdash;liberally endowed by wealth, and loved the women!</p>

<p>It was Baron &mdash;&mdash;'s province to find out the weak points
of each victim.</p>

<p>"If he has a <i>particular</i> regard for <i>poetry</i>, he does love
the fine arts," quoth the Baron, "and women are the queens
of <i>fine arts</i>. I'll have him!"</p>

<p>In the secret prison of Shaubert he found an old man,
confined for&mdash;he could not learn what. Every day, the yet
youthful and most fascinating, voluptuous and beautiful
daughter of the old man, visited his cell, which was adjoining
that of Shaubert's. As she did so, it was not long before
she found occasion to linger at the door of the widower,
the poet&mdash;and sigh so piteously as to draw from the
victim, at first a holy poem, and at length an amative love
lay. Like fire into tow did this effusion of the poet's quill
inflame the breast and arouse the passions of the lovely
Bertha; and in an obscure hour, after pouring forth the
soul's burden of most vehement love, the angel in woman's
form(!), with implements as perfect as the very jailor's,
opened all the bolts and bars, and led the captive forth to
liberty! She would have the poet who had entranced
her, fly and leave her to her fate! But <i>poetry</i> scorned such
dastardy&mdash;it was but to brave the uncertainty of fate to
stay, and torture to go&mdash;Bertha must fly with him. She
had a father&mdash;could she leave him in bondage? No! She
had rescued her lover&mdash;she braved more&mdash;released her
parent in the next hour, by the same mysterious means, and
giving herself up to the tempest of love, she shared in the
flight of the poet. In a remote section of chivalric Bohemia,
they found an asylum. But Bertha was as yet but
the deliverer from bondage, if not death, of her soul's idol;
he, with all the warmth and gratitude of a dozen poets, worshipped
at her feet and besought her to bless him evermore
by sharing his fate and fortune. There was a something
imposing, a something that brought the pearly tear to the
heroic girl's eye and made that lovely bosom undulate with
most sad emotion. The poet pressed her to his heart&mdash;fell
at her feet, and begged that if his life&mdash;property&mdash;children&mdash;be
the sacrifice&mdash;but let him know the secret at once&mdash;he
was her friend&mdash;defender&mdash;lover&mdash;slave. Another sigh,
and the spell was broken.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;ah! why were you a state prisoner&mdash;a <i>secret</i>
prisoner in the &mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Loved angel," answered the poet, "I scarce can tell;
indeed I have not the merest <i>hint</i>, in my own mind, to tell
me for what I was arrested and thrown into prison!"</p>

<p>"Ah! sir," sighed the lovely Bertha, "I can never then
wed the man I love&mdash;I cannot brave the dangers of an unknown
fate&mdash;at some moment least expected, to be torn
from his arms&mdash;lost to him forever!"</p>

<p>"We can fly, dearest," suggested the poet, "we can fly to
other and more secure lands. In the sunshine of your sweet
smile, my dear Bertha, obscurity&mdash;poverty would be nothing."</p>

<p>"No," said the girl, "I cannot leave my father&mdash;the
land of my birth&mdash;home of my childhood. I that have given
you liberty, may point out a way to deliver you from further
restraint. How I learned the nature of your crime, ask
not; I know your secret."</p>

<p>"Ah! what mean you?"</p>

<p>"In a foolish hour," continued the lovely Bertha, with
downcast eyes and heaving bosom, "you impaled your
generous self to save a friend&mdash;the friend fled&mdash;you were arrested&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the poet, "Herr Beethoven&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gave you possession of&mdash;&mdash;" she continued.</p>

<p>"No! no! no!" interposed the affrighted poet, daring
not to breathe "yes," even to the ear of his fair preserver.</p>

<p>"Sir," calmly continued the girl, "I have risked my own
life and liberty to preserve yours, I have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I know it all, dear&mdash;dearest angel, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those manuscripts," she continued, fixing her keen but
melting gaze upon the poor victim.</p>

<p>"Ha! manuscripts? How learned you this? No, no, it cannot be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is known&mdash;I know it&mdash;I learned it from your captors;
but for my <i>love</i>," said the girl, "mad&mdash;guilty love&mdash;your
life would have been forfeited&mdash;your house pillaged by the
emissaries of the Emperor, in quest of those manuscripts.
While they exist, Bertha cannot be happy&mdash;Bertha's love
must die with her&mdash;Bertha be ever miserable!"</p>

<p>"I-a&mdash;I will&mdash;but no! no! I have no manuscripts! It
is false&mdash;false!" exclaimed the almost distracted poet.</p>

<p>"Herr Shaubert," said the girl, clasping the hand of the
poet, and throwing herself at his feet, "am I unworthy
your love?"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Bertha, do not torture me! do not, for
God's sake! Rise; let me at your feet swear, in answer&mdash;<i>No!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then, within four-and-twenty hours, let me grasp that
hated, damned viper, that would gnaw the heart's core of
Bertha. Give me the key of your misery; O! bless me&mdash;bless
your Bertha; give me those accursed manuscripts,
daggers bequeathed you by a false friend, that I may at
once, in your presence, give them to the flames; and Bertha,
the idol of your soul, be ever more blessed and happy!"</p>

<p>This appeal settled the business of the poet; he walked
the room, sighed, tore his <i>mouchoir</i>, oscillated between
honor and temptation&mdash;the angel form and syren tongue
of the woman triumphed. In course of a dozen hours,
Bertha, the lovely, enchanting <i>spy</i>, opened the secret
drawers of the poet's secretary, and amid carefully-packed
literary rubbish, the dreaded <i>memorial</i> was found&mdash;clutched
with the eagerness of a death-reprieve to a poor felon upon
the verge of eternity, and with the despatch of an hundred
swift relays, the poor author's manuscripts were placed in
the hands of the mighty Emperor, and while he read their
fearful purport, and flashed with rage or grew livid with
each scathing word of the <i>memorial</i>, he hurriedly issued
his orders&mdash;gain to this one, sacrifice to that one; while
he made the spy a <i>countess</i>, he ordered hideous death to
the poor poet and despair and misery to his children.</p>

<p>"Fly!" the monarch shouted, "search every one suspected
of a hand in this; let them be dealt with instantly&mdash;trouble
me not with detail, but give me sure returns.
Stop not, until this viper is exterminated; egg and tooth;
fang and scale; see it done and claim my bounty&mdash;<i>fly!</i>"</p>

<p>That <i>snake</i> was scotched and killed&mdash;the few brief pages
of an obscure author that drove sleep, appetite and peace
from the mighty Emperor, for days and nights&mdash;made busy
work for his thousands of emissaries&mdash;scattered his gold in
weighty streams&mdash;was read, cursed and destroyed, and all
suspected as having the slightest voice or opinion in the
secret <i>memorial</i>, met a secret fate&mdash;death or prolonged wretchedness.</p>

<p>Herr Beethoven, the poor author, alone escaped; being
overlooked in the hot pursuit of his production, and by the
blunder of those having charge of himself and hundreds of
other state prisoners&mdash;guilty or <i>suspected</i> opponents to the
vaulting ambition and power of him that at last ended his
own eventful career as a helpless prisoner upon an ocean
isle&mdash;was liberated and lost no time in making his way beyond
the reach of monarchs, tyranny and bondage. Beethoven
came to America and settled in Philadelphia, where,
in the humble capacity of an e-razer of beards and pruner
of human mops, he eked out a reasonable existence for the
residue of his earthly existence; few, perhaps, dreaming in
their profoundest philosophy, that the little, eccentric-attired,
grotesque-looking barber, who tweaked their plebeian
noses and combed their caputs, once rejoiced in grand heraldic
escutcheons upon his carriage panels as a veritable
Count, and still later made the throne tremble beneath the
feet of a second Alexander!</p>

<p>But God is great, and the ways of our every-day life, full
of change and mystery.</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="the_Better_Luck" id="the_Better_Luck"></a>The Bigger Fool, the Better Luck.</h2>


<p>The American "Ole Bull," young Howard, one of the
most scientific crucifiers of the <i>violin</i> we ever heard,
gave us a call t'other day, and not only discoursed heavenly
music upon his instrument, but gave us the "nub" of a
few jokes worth dishing up in our peculiar style. Howard
spent last winter in a tour over the State of <i>Maine</i> and
Canada. During this <i>cool</i> excursion, he got way up among
the <i>wood</i>-choppers and <i>log</i>-men of the Aroostook and
Penobscot country. These wood-chopping and log-rolling
gentry, according to all accounts, must be a jolly, free-and-easy,
hard-toiling and hardy race. The "folks" up about
there live in very primitive style; their camps and houses
are very useful, but not much addicted to the "ornamental."
Howard had a very long, tedious and perilous
<i>tramp</i>, on foot, during a part of his peregrinations, and
coming at last upon the settlement of the log-men, he laid
up several days, to recuperate. In the largest log building
of the several in the neighborhood, Howard lodged; the
weather was intensely cold&mdash;house crowded, and wood and
game plenty. After a hard day's toil, in snow and water,
these log-men felt very much inclined, to sleep. A huge
fire was usually left upon the hearth, after the "tea things"
were put away, Howard gave them a <i>choon</i> or two, and then
the woodmen lumbered up a rude set of steps&mdash;into a capacious
loft overhead, and there, amid the old quilts, robes, skins
and straw, enjoyed their sound and refreshing sleep&mdash;with
a slight drawback.</p>

<p>Among these men of the woods, was a hard old nut, called
and known among them as&mdash;<i>Old Tantabolus!</i> He was a
wiry and hardy old rooster; though his frosty poll spoke
of the many, many years he had "been around," his body
was yet firm and his perceptions yet clear. The old man
was a grand spinner of yarns; he had been all around
creation, and various other places not set down in the maps.
He had been a soldier and sailor: been blown up and shot
down: had had all the various ills flesh was heir to: suffered
from shipwreck and indigestion: witnessed the frowns
and smiles of fortune&mdash;especially the <i>frowns</i>; in short, according
to old man Tantabolus's own account of himself,
he had seen more ups and downs, and made more narrow
and wonderful escapes, than Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver
both together&mdash;with Baron Trenck into the bargain!</p>

<p>For the first season, the old man and his narrations, being
fresh and novel, he was quite a <i>lion</i> among the woodmen,
but now that the novelty had worn off, and they'd got
used to his long yarns, they voted him "an old bore!" The
old fellow smoked a tremendous pipe, with tobacco strong
enough to give a Spaniard the "yaller fever." He would
eat his supper, light his pipe&mdash;sit down by the fire, and
spin yarns, as long as a listener remained, and longer. In
short, Old Tantabolus would <i>spin</i> them all to bed, and
then make their heads spin, with the clouds of <i>baccy</i> smoke
with which he'd fill the <i>ranche</i>.</p>

<p>Going to bed, at length, on a bunk in a corner, the old
chap would wheeze and snore for an hour or two, and then
turning out again, between daybreak and midnight, Old
Tantabolus would pile on a cord or two of fresh wood&mdash;raise
a roaring fire&mdash;make the <i>ranche</i> hot enough to roast
an ox, then treat all hands to another <i>stifling</i> with his
old <i>calumet</i>, and nigger-head tobacco! Then would commence a&mdash;</p>

<p>"A-booh! oo-<i>oo!</i>" by one of the lodgers, overhead.</p>

<p>"Boo-oo-<i>ooh!</i> Old Tantabolus's got that&mdash;booh-oo-oo-<i>oo</i>,&mdash;pipe
of his'n again,&mdash;boo-oo-oo!" chimed another.</p>

<p>"A-a-a-<i>chee!</i> oo-oo-augh-h-h-<i>ch-chee!</i>
Cuss that&mdash;a-<i>chee</i>&mdash;pipe.
Tantabolus, you old hoss-marine, put out
that&mdash;a-<i>chee!</i>&mdash;darn'd old pipe!" bawled another.</p>

<p>"A'<i>nand</i>?" was the old fellow's usual reply.</p>

<p>"A-boo-ooh-<i>ooh!</i>" hoarse and loud as a boatswain's
call, in a gale of wind, would be issued from the throat of
an old "logger," as the fumigacious odor interfered with
his respiratory arrangements, and then would follow a miscellaneous&mdash;</p>

<p>"A-<i>chee</i>-o! Ah-<i>chee!</i> boo-ooh-oo-<i>ooh!</i>" tapering off
with divers curses and threats, upon Old Tantabolus and
his villanous habits of arousing "the whole community" in
"the dead watches and middle of the night," with heat and
smoke, no flesh and blood but his own could apparently endure.</p>

<p>At length, a private <i>caucus</i> was held, and a diabolical
plan set, to put a summary end to the grievous nuisances
engendered by Old Tantabolus&mdash;"<i>let's blow him up!</i>"</p>

<p>And this they agreed to do in <i>this</i> wise. Before "retiring
to rest," as we say in civilized <i>parlance</i>, the lodging
community were in the habit of laying in a surplus of
firewood, alongside of the capacious fire-place, in order&mdash;should
a very common occurrence <i>occur</i>,&mdash;i. e., a fall of
snow six to ten feet deep, and kiver things all up, the insiders
might have wherewith to make themselves comfortable,
until they could work out and provide more. But Old
Tantabolus was in the wasteful practice of turning out and
burning up all this extra fuel; so the caucus agreed to bore
an inch and a quarter hole into a solid stick&mdash;pack it with
powder&mdash;lay it among the wood, and when Old Tantabolus
<i>riz</i> to fire up, he'd be blowed out of the building, and
disappear&mdash;<i>in a blue blaze!</i> Well, poor old man, Tantabolus,
quite unconscious of the dire explosion awaiting him, told
his yarns, next evening, with greater <i>gusto</i> than usual, and
one after another of his listeners finally dropped off to <i>roost</i>,
in the loft above, leaving the old man to go it alone&mdash;finish
his pipe, stagnate the air and go to his bunk, which,
as was his wont to do&mdash;he did. Stillness reigned supreme;
though Old Tantabolus took his usual snooze in very apparent
confidence, many of his no less weary companions
above&mdash;watched for the approaching <i>tableaux!</i> And they
were gratified, to their heart's content, for the tableaux <i>came!</i></p>

<p>"Now, look out, boys!" says one, "Old <i>Tanty's</i> about
to wake up!" and then some dozen of the upper story
lodgers, who had kept their peepers open to enjoy the fun,
began to spread around and pull away the loose straw in
order to get a view of the scene below. Sure enough, the
old rooster gave a long yawn&mdash;"Aw-w-w-w-<i>um!</i>" flirted
off his "kiverlids" and got up, making a slow move towards
the fire-place, reaching which, he gave an extra
"Aw-w-w-<i>um!</i>" knocked the ashes out of his pipe&mdash;filled
it up with "nigger-head," dipped it in the embers, gave it
a few whiffs, and then said:</p>

<p>"Booh! cold mornin'; boys'll freeze, if I don't start
up a good fire." Then he went to work to cultivate a
blaze, with a few chips and light sticks of dry wood.</p>

<p>"Ah, by George, old feller," says one, "you'll catch a
bite, before you know it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm blamed if you ain't a <i>goner</i>, Old Tantabolus!"
says another, in a pig's whisper.</p>

<p>"There! there he's got the fire up&mdash;now look out!"</p>

<p>"He's got the stick&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goin' to clap it on!"</p>

<p>"Now it's on!"</p>

<p>"Look out for fun, by George, look out!"</p>

<p>"He'll blow the house up!"</p>

<p>"Godfrey! s'pose he does?"</p>

<p>"What an infernal <i>wind</i> there is this morning!" says the
old fellow, hearing the <i>buzz</i> and indistinct whispering
overhead; "guess it's snowin' like <i>sin</i>; I'll jist start up this
fire and go out and see." But, he had scarcely reached
and opened the door, when&mdash;"<i>bang-g-g!</i>" went the log,
with the roar of a twelve pounder; hurling the fire, not
only all over the lower floor, but through the upper loose
flooring&mdash;setting the straw beds in a blaze&mdash;filling the
house with smoke, ashes and fire! There was a general
and indiscriminate <i>rush</i> of the practical jokers in the loft,
to make an escape from the now burning building; but the
step-ladder was knocked down, and it was at the peril
of their lives, that all hands jumped and crawled out of
the <i>ranche!</i> The only one who escaped the real danger
was Old Tantabolus, the intended victim, whose remark
was, after the flurry was over&mdash;"Boys, arter this, <i>be careful
how you lay your powder round!</i>"</p>

Borax, or some of the other historians, by hunting.
The wolves act as watchmen at night, relieved now and

relieving straggling citizens of their top-knots. A man
engaged in a quiet smoke, sees a deer or bear sneaking

and a haunch for next day's dinner, right at his door.
Vegetables and fruit grow naturally; flowers come up and

buck-skin trowsers, coon-skin hats, buffalo-skin overcoats,
and alligator-hide boots. Old San Jacinto walked into

<p>"Conscience sakes! but hain't they got a lot of pork
here?" said a looker-on in Quincy Market, t'other day.</p>

<p>"Pork!" echoes a decidedly <i>Green</i> Mountain biped, at
the elbow of the first speaker.</p>

<p>"Yes, I vow it's quite as-<i>tonishing</i> how much pork is
sold here and <i>et</i> up by somebody," continued the old gent.</p>

<p>"Et up?" says the other, whose physical structure somewhat
resembled a fat lath, and whose general <i>contour</i> made
it self-evident that <i>he</i> was not given much to frivolity,
jauntily-fitting coats and breeches, or perfumed and "fixed
up" barberality extravagance.</p>

<p>"Et up!" he thoughtfully and earnestly repeated, as his
hands rested in the cavity of his trousers pockets, and his
eyes rested upon the first speaker.</p>

<p>"You wern't never in Cincinnatty, <i>I</i> guess?"</p>

<p>"No, I never was," says the old gent.</p>

<p>"Never was? Well, I cal'lated not. Never been <i>in</i> a
Pork-haouse?"</p>

<p>"Never, unless you may call this a Pork-house?"</p>

<p>"The-is? Pork-haouse?" says Yankee. "Well, I reckon
not&mdash;don't begin&mdash;'tain't nothin' like&mdash;not a speck in a
puddle to a Pork-haouse&mdash;a Cincinnatty Pork-haouse!"</p>

<p>"I've hearn that they carry on the Pork business pooty
stiff, out there," says the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Pooty stiff? Good gravy, but don't they? 'Pears to
me, I knew yeou somewhere?" says our Yankee.</p>

<p>"You might," cautiously answers the old gent.</p>

<p>"'Tain't 'Squire Smith, of Maoun-Peelier?"</p>

<p>"N'no, my name's Johnson, sir."</p>

<p>"Johnson? Oh, in the tin business?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'm not <i>in</i> business, at all, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Not? Oh,"&mdash;thoughtfully echoes Yankee. "Wall, no
matter, I thought p'raps yeou were from up aour way&mdash;I'm
from near Maoun-Peelier&mdash;State of Varmount."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed?"</p>

<p>"Ya-a-s."</p>

<p>"Fine country, I'm told?" says the old gent.</p>

<p>"Ye-a-a-s, 'tis;"&mdash;was the abstracted response of Yankee,
who seemed to be revolving something in his own mind.</p>

<p>"Raise a great deal of wool&mdash;fine sheep country?"</p>

<p>"'Tis great on sheep. But sheep ain't nothin' to the
everlasting hog craop!"</p>

<p>"Think not, eh?" said the old gent.</p>

<p>"I swow <i>teu</i> pucker, if I hain't seen more hogs killed,
afore breakfast, in Cincinnatty, than would burst this
buildin' clean open!"</p>

<p>"You don't tell me so?"</p>

<p>"By gravy, I deu, though. You hain't never been in Cincinnatty?"</p>

<p>"I said not."</p>

<p>"Never in a Pork-haouse?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Wall, yeou've hearn tell&mdash;of Ohio, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! got a daughter living out there," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Yeou don't say so?"</p>

<p>"I have, in Urbana, or near it," said the old gent.</p>

<p>"Urbanny! Great kingdom! why I know teu men living

be yeou know 'em&mdash;Sampson Wheeler's one, Jethro Jones's

Small, and I was talkin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About the hog crop, Cincinnatty Pork-houses."</p>

<p>"Ye-a-a-s; wall, I went eout West last fall, stopped at
Cincinnatty&mdash;teu weeks. Dreadful nice place; by gravy,
they do deu business there; beats Salvation haow they go
it on steamboats&mdash;bust ten a day and build six!"</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" says the old gent; "but the hogs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deu beat all. I went up to the Pork-haouses;&mdash;fus
thing you meet is a string&mdash;'bout a mile long, of big and
little critters, greasy and sassy as sin; buckets and bags
full of scraps, tails, ears, snaouts and ribs of hogs. Foller
up this line and yeou come to the Pork-haouses, and yeou
go in, if they let yeou, and they did me, so in I went, teu
an almighty large haouse&mdash;big as all aout doors, and a
feller steps up to me and says he:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Yeou're a stranger, I s'pose?'</p>

<p>"'Yeou deu?' says I.</p>

<p>"'Ye-a-a-s,' says he, 'I s'pose so,' and I up and said I was.</p>

<p>"'Wall,' says he, 'ef you want to go over the haouse,
we'll send a feller with you!'</p>

<p>"So I went with the feller, and he took me way back,
daown stairs&mdash;aout in a lot; a-a-a-nd everlastin' sin! yeou
should jist seen the hogs&mdash;couldn't caount 'em in three weeks!"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaims the old gent.</p>

<p>"Fact, by gravy! Sech squealin', kickin' and goin' on;
sech cussin' and hollerin', by the fellers pokin' 'em in at one
eend of the lot and punchin' on 'em aout at t'other! Sech
a smell of hogs and fat, <i>brissels</i> and hot water, I swan <i>teu</i>
pucker, I never did cal'late on, afore!</p>

<p>"Wall, as fast as they driv' 'em in by droves, the fellers
kept a craowdin' 'em daown towards the Pork-haouse; there
two fellers kept a shootin' on 'em daown, and a hull gang
of the all-firedest dirty, greasy-looking fellers <i>aout</i>&mdash;stuck
'em, hauled 'em daown, and afore yeou could say Sam
Patch! them hogs were yanked aout of the lot&mdash;killed&mdash;scalded
and scraped."</p>

<p>"Mighty quick work, I guess," says the old gent.</p>

<p>"Quick work? Yeou ought to see 'em. Haow many
hogs deu yeou cal'late them fellers killed and scraped a day?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't possibly say&mdash;hundreds, I expect."</p>

<p>"Hundreds! Grea-a-at King! Why, I see 'em kill
thirteen hundred in teu hours;&mdash;did, by golly!"</p>

<p>"Yeou don't say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>. And a feller with grease enough abaout him
to make a barrel of saft soap, said that when they hurried
'em up some they killed, scalded and scraped ten thousand
hogs in a day; and when they put on the steam, twenty
thousand porkers were killed off and cut up in a single day!"</p>

<p>"I want to know!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Wall, we went into the haouse, where they
scalded the critters fast as they brought 'em in. By gravy,
it was amazin' how the <i>brissels</i> flew! Afore a hog knew
what it was all abaout, he was bare as a punkin&mdash;a hook
and tackle in his <i>snaout</i>, and up they snaked him on to the
next floor. I vow they kept a slidin' and snakin' 'em in
and up through the scuttles&mdash;jest in one stream!</p>

<p>"'Let's go up and see 'em cut the hogs,' says the feller.</p>

<p>"Up we goes. Abaout a hundred greasy fellers were a
hacken on 'em up. By golly, it was deth to particular
people the way the fat and grease <i>flew!</i> Two <i>whacks</i>&mdash;fore
and aft, as Uncle Jeems used to say&mdash;split the hog;
one whack, by a greasy feller with an everlasting chunk of
sharpened iron, and the hog was quartered&mdash;grabbed and
carried off to another block, and then a set of savagerous-lookin'
chaps layed to and cut and skirted around;&mdash;hams
and shoulders were going one way, sides and middlins another
way; wall, I'm screwed if the hull room didn't 'pear
to be full of flying pork&mdash;in hams, sides, scraps and greasy
fellers&mdash;rippin' and a tearin'! Daown in another place they
were saltin' and packin' away, like sin! Daown in the other
place they were frying aout the lard&mdash;fillin' barrels, from a
regular river of fat, coming aout of the everlastin' biggest
bilers yeou ever did see, I vow! Now, I asked the feller
if sich hurryin' a hog through a course of spraouts helped
the pork any, and he said it didn't make any difference, he
s'pected. He said they were not hurryin' then, but if I
would come in, some day, when 'steam was up,' he'd show
me quick work in the pork business&mdash;knock daown, drag
aout, scrape, cut up, and have the hog in the barrel <i>before
he got through squealin'!</i></p>

<p>"Hello! Say!&mdash;'Squire, gone?"</p>

<p>The old gent was&mdash;<i>gone</i>; the <i>last brick</i> hit him!</p>

<h2><a name="Great_Dog_Sell" id="Great_Dog_Sell"></a>Ben. McConachy's Great Dog Sell.</h2>


<p>A great many dogmas have been written, and may
continue to be written, on dogs. Confessing, once,
to a dogmatical regard for dogs, we "went in" for the canine
race, with a zeal we have bravely outgrown; and we
live to wonder how men&mdash;to say nothing of spinsters of an
uncertain age&mdash;can heap money and affections upon these
four-legged brutes, whose sole utility is to doze in the
corner or kennel, terrify stray children, annoy horsemen,
and keep wholesome meat from the stomachs of many a
poor, starving beggar at your back gate. There is no use
for dogs in the city, and precious little <i>use</i> for them any
where else; and as <i>Boz</i> says of oysters&mdash;you always find a
preponderance of dogs where you find the most poor people.
Philadelphia's the place for dogs; in the suburbs, especially
after night, if you escape from the onslaught of the
rowdies, you will find the dogs a still greater and more
atrocious nuisance. No rowdy, or gentleman at large, in
the <i>Quaker City</i>, feels <i>finished</i>, without a lean, lank, hollow
dog trotting along at their heels; while the butchers and
horse-dealers revel in a profusion of mastiffs and dastardly
curs, perfectly astounding&mdash;to us. This brings us to a
short and rather pithy story of a dog <i>sell</i>.</p>

<p>Some years ago, a knot of men about town, gentlemen
highly "posted up" on dogs, and who could talk <i>hoss</i> and dog
equal to a Lord Bentick, or Hiram Woodruff, or "Acorn,"
or Col. Bill Porter, of the "Spirit," were congregated in a
famous resort, a place known as <i>Hollahan's</i>. A dog-fight
that afternoon, under the "Linden trees," in front of the
"State House," gave rise to a spirited debate upon the
result of the battle, and the respective merits of the two
dogs. Words waxed warm, and the disputants grew boisterously
eloquent upon dogs of high and low degree,&mdash;dogs
they had read of, and dogs they had seen; and, in fact, we
much doubt, if ever before or since&mdash;this side of "Seven
Dials" or St. Giles', there was a more thorough and animated
discussion, on dogs, witnessed.</p>

<p>An old and rusty codger, one whose outward bruises
might have led a disciple of <i>Paley</i> to imagine they had
caused a secret enjoyment within, sat back in the nearest
corner, towards the stove, a most attentive auditor to the
thrilling debate. Between his outspread feet, a dog was
coiled up, the only indifferent individual present, apparently
unconcerned upon the subject.</p>

<p>"Look here," says the old codger, tossing one leg over
t'other, and taking an easy and convenient attitude of observation;
"look here, boys, you're talkin' about <i>dogs!</i>"</p>

<p>"Dogs?" says one of the most prominent speakers.</p>

<p>"Dogs," echoes the old one.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, daddy, we are talking about dogs."</p>

<p>"What do you know about <i>dogs?</i>" says a full-blown
<i>Jakey</i>, looking sharply at the old fellow.</p>

<p>"Know about <i>dogs?</i>"</p>

<p>"A' yes-s," says <i>Jakey</i>. "I bet dis five dollars, ole feller,
you don't know a Spaniel from a butcher's <i>cur!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well," responds the old one, transposing his legs, "may
be I <i>don't</i>, but it's <i>my</i> 'pinion you'd make a sorry <i>fiste</i> at
best, if you had tail and ears a little longer!"</p>

<p>This <i>sally</i> amused all but the young gentleman who "run
wid de machine," and attracted general attention towards
the old man, in whose eyes and wrinkles lurked a goodly
share of mother wit and shrewdness. <i>Jakey</i> backing
down, another of the by-standers put in.</p>

<p>"Poppy, I expect you know what a good dog is?"</p>

<p>"I reckon, boys, I orter. But I'm plaguy dry listening
to your dog talk&mdash;confounded dry!"</p>

<p>"What'll you drink, daddy?" said half a dozen of the
dog fanciers, thinking to wet the old man's whistle to get
some fun out of him. "What'll you drink?&mdash;come up, daddy."</p>

<p>"Sperrets, boys, good old sperrets," and the old codger
drank; then giving his lips a wipe with the back of his
hand, and drawing out a long, deep "ah-h-h-h!" he again
took his seat, observing, as he partially aroused his ugly
and cross-grained mongrel&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's a <i>dog</i>, boys."</p>

<p>"That <ins title="you're">your</ins> dog, dad?" asked several.</p>

<p>"That's my dog, boys. He <i>is</i> a dog."</p>

<p>"Ain't he, tho'?" jocularly responded the dog men.</p>

<p>"What breed, daddy, do you call that dog of yours?"
asked one.</p>

<p>"Breed? He ain't any breed, <i>he</i> ain't. Stand up, Barney,
(jerking up the sneaking-looking thing.) He's no
breed, boys; look at him&mdash;see his tushes; growl, Barney,
growl!&mdash;Ain't them tushes, boys? He's no breed, boys;
<i>he's original stock!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, so I was going to say," says one.</p>

<p>"That dog," says another, "must be valuable."</p>

<p>"Waluable?" re-echoes the old man; "he is all that,
boys; I wouldn't sell him; but, boys, I'm dry, dry as a
powder horn&mdash;so much talkin' makes one dry."</p>

<p>"Well, come up, poppy; what'll you take?" said the boys.</p>

<p>"Sperrets, boys; good old sperrets. I do like good
sperrets, boys, and that sperrets, Mister (to the ruffled-bosomed
bar-keeper), o' your'n is like my dog&mdash;<i>can't be beat!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, daddy," continued the dog men, "where'd you
get your dog?"</p>

<p>"That dog," said the old fellow, again giving his mouth
a back-hander, and his "ah-h-h!" accompaniment; "well,
I'll tell you, boys, all about it."</p>

<p>"Do, poppy, that's right; now, tell us all about it,"
they cried.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, 'd any you know Ben. McConachy, out here
at the Risin' Sun Tavern?"</p>

<p>"We've heard of him, daddy&mdash;go on," says they.</p>

<p>"Well, I worked for Ben. McConachy, one winter; he
was a pizen mean man, but his wife&mdash;wasn't she mean?
Why, boys, she'd spread all the bread with butter afore we
sat down to breakfast; she'd begin with a quarter pound
of butter, and when she'd got through, she had twice as
much left."</p>

<p>"But how about the dog, daddy? Come, tell us about
your <i>dog</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I'll tell you, boys. You see, Ben. McConachy
owned this dog; set up, Barney&mdash;look at his ears,
boys&mdash;great, ain't they? Well, Ben's wife was mean&mdash;meaner
than pizen. She hated this dog; she hated any
thing that <i>et</i>; she considered any body, except her and her
daughter (a pizen ugly gal), that et three pieces of bread
and two cups of coffee at a meal, <i>awful!</i>"</p>

<p>"Blow the old woman; tell us about the <i>dog</i>, poppy,"
said they.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm coming to the pint&mdash;but, Lord! boys, I never
was so dry in my life. I am dry&mdash;plaguy dry," said the
old one.</p>

<p>"Well, daddy, step up and take something; come,"
said the dog men; "now let her slide. How about the <i>dog?</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah-h-h-h! that's great sperrets, boys. Mister (to the
bar-keeper), I don't find such sperrets as that <i>often</i>. Well,
boys, as you're anxious to hear about the dog, I'll tell you
all about him. You see, the old woman and Ben. was allers
spatten 'bout one thing or t'other, and 'specially about this
dog. So one day Ben. McConachy hears a feller wanted to
buy a good dog, down to the <i>drove yard</i>, and he takes
Barney&mdash;stand up, Barney&mdash;see that, boys; how quick he
minds! Great dog, he is. Well, Ben. takes Barney, and
down he goes to the <i>drove yard</i>. He met the feller; the
feller looked at the dog; he saw Barney <i>was</i> a dog&mdash;he
looked at him, asked how old he was; if that was all the
dog Ben. owned, and he seemed to like the dog&mdash;but, boys,
I'm gittin' dry&mdash;<i>rotted dry</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, tell us all about the dog, then we'll drink," says
the boys.</p>

<p>"'Well,' says Ben. McConachy to the feller, 'now, make
us an offer for him.' Now, what do you suppose, boys, that
feller's first offer was?"</p>

<p>The boys couldn't guess it; they guessed and guessed;
some one price, some another, all the way from five to fifty
dollars&mdash;the old fellow continuing to say "No," until they
gave it up.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I'll tell you&mdash;that feller, after looking and
looking at Ben. McConachy's dog, tail to snout, half an
hour&mdash;<i>didn't offer a red cent for him!</i> Ben. come home in
disgust and give the dog to me&mdash;there he is. Now, boys,
we'll have that sperrets."</p>

<p>But on looking around, the boys had cut the pit&mdash;<i>mizzled!</i></p>

<h2><a name="Perils_of_Wealth" id="Perils_of_Wealth"></a>The Perils of Wealth</h2>


<p>Money is admitted to be&mdash;there is no earthly use of
dodging the fact&mdash;the lever of the whole world, by
which it and its multifarious cargo of men and matters, mountains
and mole hills, wit, wisdom, weal, woe, warfare and
women, are kept in motion, in season and out of season. It
is the arbiter of our fates, our health, happiness, life and death.
Where it makes one man a happy <i>Christian</i>, it makes ten
thousand miserable <i>devils</i>. It is no use to argufy the matter,
for money is the "root of all evil," more or less, and&mdash;as
Patricus Hibernicus is supposed to have said of a single
feather he reposed on&mdash;if a dollar gives some men so much
uneasiness, what must a million do? Money has formed
the basis of many a long and short story, and we only wish
that they were all imbued, as our present story is, with&mdash;more
irresistible mirth than misery. Lend us your ears.</p>

<p>Not long ago, one of our present well-known&mdash;or ought
to be, for he is a man of parts&mdash;business men of Boston,
resided and carried on a small "trade and dicker" in the
city of Portland. By frugal care and small profits, he had
managed to save up some six hundred dollars, all in <i>halves</i>,
finding himself in possession of this vast sum of hard cash,
he began to conceive a rather insignificant notion of <i>small
cities</i>; and he concluded that Portland was hardly big
enough for a man of his pecuniary heft! In short, he began
to feel the importance of his position in the world of finance,
and conceived the idea that it would be a sheer waste of
time and energy to stay in Portland, while with <i>his</i> capital,
he could go to Boston, and spread himself among the millionaires
and hundred thousand dollar men!</p>

<p>"Yes," said B&mdash;&mdash;, "I'll go to Boston; I'd be a fool to
stay here any longer; I'll leave for bigger timber. But
what will I do with my money? How will I invest it?
Hadn't I better go and take a look around, before I conclude
to move? My wife don't know I've got this money,"
he continued, as he mused over matters one evening, in his
sanctum; "I'll not tell her of it yet, but say I'm just going
to Boston to see how business is there in my line; and my
money I'll put in an old cigar box, and&mdash;"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>B&mdash;&mdash; was all ready with his valise and umbrella in his
hand. His "good-bye" and all that, to his wife, was
uttered, and for the tenth time he charged his better half
to be careful of the fire, (he occupied a frame house,) see
that the doors were all locked at night, and "be sure and
fasten the cellar doors."</p>

<p>B&mdash;&mdash; had got out on to the pavement, with no time to
spare to reach the cars in season; yet he halted&mdash;ran back&mdash;opened
the door, and in evident concern, bawled out to
his wife&mdash;</p>

<p>"Caddie!"</p>

<p>"Well?" she answered.</p>

<p>"Be sure to fasten the alley gate!"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-e-s!" responded the wife, from the interior of
the house.</p>

<p>"And whatever you do, <i>don't forget them cellar doors</i>, Caddie!"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-e-s!" she repeated, and away went B&mdash;&mdash;,
lickety split, for the Boston train.</p>

<p>After a general and miscellaneous survey of modern
Athens, B&mdash;&mdash; found an opening&mdash;a good one&mdash;to go into
business, as he desired, upon a liberal scale; but he found
vent for the explosion of one very hallucinating idea&mdash;his
six hundred dollars, as a cash capital, was a most infinitesimal
<i>circumstance</i>, a mere "flea bite;" would do very well
for an amateur in the cake and candy, pea-nut or vegetable
business, but was hardly sufficient to create a sensation
among the monied folks of Milk street, or "bulls" and
"bears" on 'change. However, this realization was more
than counter-balanced by another fact&mdash;"confidence" was a
largely developed <i>bump</i> on the business head of Boston,
and if a man merely lacked "means," yet possessed an
abundance of good business qualifications&mdash;spirit, energy,
talent and tact&mdash;they were bound to see him through! In
short, B&mdash;&mdash;, the great Portland capitalist, found things
about right, and in good time, and in the best of spirits,
started for home, determining, in his own mind, to give his
wife a most pleasant surprise, in apprizing her of the fact
that she was not only the wife of a man with six hundred
silver dollars, and about to move his <i>institution</i>&mdash;but the
better half of a gentleman on the verge of a new campaign
as a Boston business man.</p>

<p>"Lord! how Caroline's eyes will snap!" said B&mdash;&mdash;;
"how she'll go in; for she's had a great desire to live in
Boston these five years, but thinks I'm in debt, and don't
begin to believe I've got them six hundred all hid away
down&mdash;&mdash;. But I'll surprise her!"</p>

<p>B&mdash;&mdash; had hardly turned his corner and got sight of his
house, with his mind fairly sizzling with the pent-up joyful
tidings and grand surprise in store for Mrs. B., when a
sudden change came over the spirit of his dream! As he
gazed over the fence, by the now dim twilight of fading
day, he thought&mdash;yes, he did see fresh earthy loose stones,
barrels of lime, mortar, and an ominous display of other
building and repairing materials, strewn in the rear of his
domicil! The cellar doors&mdash;those wings of the subterranean
recesses of his house&mdash;which he had cautioned, earnestly
cautioned, the "wife of his bussim" to close, carefully and
securely, were sprawling open, and indeed, the outside of
his abode looked quite dreary and haunted.</p>

<p>"My dear Caroline!" exclaimed B&mdash;&mdash;, rushing into the
rear door of his domestic establishment, to the no small
surprise of Mrs. B., who gave a premature&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh dear! how you frightened me, Fred! Got home?"</p>

<p>"Home? yes! don't you see I have. But, Carrie, didn't
I earnestly beg of you to keep those doors&mdash;cellar doors&mdash;shut? fastened?"</p>

<p>"Why, how you talk! Bless me! Keep the cellar shut?
Why, there's nothing in the cellar."</p>

<p>"Nothing in the cellar?" fairly howls B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Nothing? Of course there is not," quietly responded
the wife; "there is nothing in the cellar; day before yesterday,
our drain and Mrs. A.'s drain got choked up; she
went to the landlord about it; he sent some men, they examined
the drain, and came back to-day with their tools
and things, and went down the cellar."</p>

<p>"<i>Down the cellar?</i>" gasped B&mdash;&mdash;, quite tragically.</p>

<p>"Down <i>the</i> cellar!" slowly repeated Mrs. B.</p>

<p>"Give me a light&mdash;quick, give me a light, Caroline!"</p>

<p>"Why, don't be a fool. I brought up all the things, the
potatoes, the meat, the squashes."</p>

<p>"P-o-o-h! blow the meat and squashes! Give me a
light!" and with a genuine melo-drama rush, B&mdash;&mdash; seized
the lamp from his wife's hand, and down the cellar stairs he
went, four steps at a lick. In a moment was heard&mdash;</p>

<p>"O-o-o-h! I'm ruined!"</p>

<p>With a full-fledged scream, Mrs. B. dashed pell-mell down
the stairs, to her husband. He had dropped the lamp&mdash;all
was dark as a coal mine.</p>

<p>"Fred&mdash;Frederick! oh! where are you? What have you
done?" cried his wife, in intense agony and doubt.</p>

<p>"Done? Oh! I'm done! yes, done now!" he heavily sighed.</p>

<p>"Done what? how? Tell me, Fred, are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"What on airth's the matter, thar? Are you committing
murder on one another?" came a voice from above stairs.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mrs. A.?" asked Mrs. B. to the last speaker.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; here's a dozen neighbors; don't get
skeert. Is thare robbers in yer house? What on airth is going on?"</p>

<p>This brought B&mdash;&mdash; to his proper reckoning. He
ordered his wife to "go up," and he followed, and upon
reaching the room, he found quite a gathering of the neighbors.
He was as white as a white-washed wall, and the
neighbors staring at him as though he was a wild Indian, or
a chained mad dog. Importuned from all sides to unravel
the mystery, B&mdash;&mdash; informed them that he had merely gone
down cellar to see what the masons, &amp;c., had been doing&mdash;dropped
his lamp&mdash;his wife screamed&mdash;and that was all
about it! The wife said nothing, and the neighbors shook
their incredulous heads, and went home; which, no sooner
had they gone, than B&mdash;&mdash; seized his hat and cut stick for
the office of a cunning, far-seeing limb of the law, leaving
Mrs. B. in a state of mental agitation better imagined than
described. B&mdash;&mdash; stated his case&mdash;he had buried six hundred
dollars in a box under the <i>lee</i> of the cellar-wall, and
gone to Boston on business, and as if no other time would
suit, a parcel of drain-cleaners, and masons, and laborers,
must come and go right there and then to dig&mdash;get the six
hundred dollars and clear.</p>

<p>After a long chase, law and bother, B&mdash;&mdash; recovered half
his money&mdash;packed up and came to Boston.&mdash;There's a
case for you! Beware of money!</p>

<h2><a name="Nursing_a_Legacy" id="Nursing_a_Legacy"></a>Nursing a Legacy.</h2>


<p>Waiting for dead men's shoes is a slow and not
very sure business; sometimes it pays and sometimes
it don't. I know a genius who lost by it, and his
case will bear repeating, for there is both morality and fun
in it.</p>

<p>Lev Smith, a native of "the Eastern shore" of Maryland,
and a resident of a small town in the lower part of
Delaware, began life on a very limited capital, and because
of a natural disposition indigenous to the climate and customs
of his native place&mdash;general apathy and unmitigated
<i>patience</i> peculiar to people raised on fish and Johnny-cake,
amid the stunted pine swamps and sand-hills of that Lord-forsaken
country&mdash;Lev never increased it. Lev had an
uncle, an old bachelor, without "chick or child," and was
reported to be pretty well off. Old man Gunter was proverbially
mean, and as usual, heartily despised by one half
of the people who knew him. He had a small estate, had
lived long, and by his close-fisted manner of life, it was believed
that Gunter had laid by a pretty considerable pile
of the root of all evil, for something or somebody; and
one day Lev Smith, the nephew, came to the conclusion
that as the old man was getting quite shaky and must soon
resign his interests in all worldly gear, <i>he</i> would volunteer
to console the declining years of his dear old uncle, by his
own pleasant company and encouragement, and the old man
very gladly accepted the proposals of Lev, to cut wood,
dig, scratch and putter around his worn out and dilapidated
farm. Uncle Gunter had but two negroes; through starvation
and long service he had worn them about out; he
had little or no "stock" upon his <i>farm</i>, quite as scant an
assortment of utensils, few fences, and in fact, to any actively
disposed individual, the general appearance and state
of affairs about old Gunter's <i>place</i> would have given the
double-breasted blues. But Lev Smith had come to loaf
and lounge, and not to display any very active or patriotic
evolutions, so he was not so much disheartened by his uncle's
dilapidated farm, as he was annoyed by the beggarly way
the old man lived, and the assiduous desire he seemed to
manifest for Lev to be stirring around, gathering chips,
patching fences, cutting brush; from morn till night, he
and the two superannuated cuffies; and the old man barely
raising enough to keep soul and body of the party together.</p>

<p>At first, the job he had undertaken proved almost too
much for Lev Smith's constitution, but the great object in
view consoled him, and the more he saw of the old man's
meanness, the more and more he took it for granted that his
uncle had necessarily hoarded up treasure; but, after three
years' drudgery, Lev's courage was on the point of breaking
down; the only stay left seemed the fact that now he had
served so long a time, so patiently and lovingly, and the
old man apparently upon his very last legs&mdash;it seemed a
ruthless waste of his golden dreams to give out, so he made
up his mind to&mdash;wait a little longer. Another year rolled
on; Uncle Gunter got indeed low, and the lower he got
the more assiduous got nephew Smith, and even the neighbors
wondered how a young man <i>could</i> stick on, and put up
with such a miserly, mean, selfish and penurious old curmudgeon
as old Joe Gunter. Gunter himself was apprized
of the great indulgence and wonderful patience of his nephew,
and not unfrequently said, in a groaning voice:</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Levi, you're a good boy; I wish to the
Lord it was in your poor, miserable, wretched old uncle's
distressed power to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind, Uncle Joe," Lev would most
deceitfully respond; "I ask nothing for myself; what I do,
I <i>do</i> willingly!"</p>

<p>"I know, I know you do, poor boy, but your poor, old,
miserable, wretched uncle don't deserve it."</p>

<p>"Don't mind that, dear uncle," says Lev. "It's my duty,
and I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Good boy, good boy; your poor, old, miserable uncle
will be grateful&mdash;we'll see."</p>

<p>"I know that&mdash;I feel sure he will, dear Uncle Joe&mdash;and
that's enough, <i>all</i> I ask."</p>

<p>"And if he don't&mdash;poor, miserable old creature,&mdash;if he
don't pay you, the Lord will, Levi!"</p>

<p>"And that will be all that's needed, Uncle Joe," says
the humbugging nephew. And so they went, Lev not only
waiting on the old man with the tender and faithful care of
a good Samaritan, but out of his own slender resources
ministering to the old man's especial comfort in many ways
and matters which Uncle Joe would have seen him hanged
and quartered before he would in a like manner done likewise.
But the end came&mdash;the old fellow held on toughly; he never
died until Lev's patience, hope and slender income were
quite threadbare; so he at last went off the handle&mdash;Lev
buried him and mourned the dispensation in true Kilkenny fashion.</p>

<p>Lev Smith now awaited the settlement of Uncle Gunter's
affairs in grief and solicitude. Another party also awaited
the upshot of the matter, with due solemnity and expectation,
and that party was Polly Williams, Lev's "intended,"
and her poor and miserly dad and marm, who knew Lev
Smith, as they said, was a lazy, lolloping sort of a feller,
but sure to get all that his poor, miserable uncle was worth
in the world, and therefore, with more craft and diligence,
if possible, than Lev practised, the Williamses set Polly's
cap for Lev, and who, in turn, was not unmindful of the
fact that Williams "had something" too, as well as his two
children, Polly and Peter. Things seemed indeed bright
and propitious on all sides. The day came; Lev was on
hand at Squire Cornelius's, to hear the will read, and the
estate of the deceased settled.</p>

<p>As usual in such cases in the country, quite a number of
the neighbors were on hand&mdash;old Williams, of course.</p>

<p>"He was a queer old mortal," began the Squire.</p>

<p>"But a good man," sobbed Lev Smith, drawing out his
bandanna, and smothering his sharp nose in it. "A good
man, 'Squire."</p>

<p>"God's his judge," responded the Squire, and a number
of the neighbors shook their head and stroked their beards,
as if to say amen.</p>

<p>"Joseph Gunter mout have been a good man and he
mout not," continued the Squire; "some thinks he was
not; I only say he was a queer old mortal, and here's his
will. Last will and testament of Joseph Gunter, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.," continued the Squire.</p>

<p>"Poor, dear old man," sobbed Lev. "Poor <i>dear</i> old man!"</p>

<p>"Being without wife or children," continued the 'Squire.</p>

<p>"O, dear! poor, dear old man, how <i>I</i> shall miss him in
this world of sorrow and sin," sobs Lev, while old Williams
bit his skinny lips, and the neighbors again stroked their beards.</p>

<p>"To comfort my declining years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor, <i>dear</i> old man, he was to be pitied; I did all I
could do," groaned the disconsolate Lev, "but I didn't do
half enough."</p>

<p>"Passing coldly and cheerless through the world&mdash;"
continued the 'Squire.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did, poor old man; O, dear!" says Lev.</p>

<p>"Cared for by none, hated and shunned by all (Lev
looked vacantly over his handkerchief, at the Squire), I
have made up my mind (Lev all attention) that no mortal
shall benefit by me; I have therefore <ins title="mortaged">mortgaged</ins> and sold
(Lev's eyes spreading) everything I had of a dollar's
value in the world, and buried the money in the earth where
none but the devil himself can find it!"</p>

<p>There was a general snicker and stare&mdash;all eyes on Lev,
his face as blank as a sham cartridge, while old Williams's
countenance fell into a concatenation of grimaces and
wrinkles&mdash;language fails to describe!</p>

<p>"But here's a codicil," says the 'Squire, re-adjusting his
glasses. "Knowing my nephew, Levi Smith, expects
something (Lev brightens up, old Williams grins!)&mdash;he
has hung around me for a long time, expecting it (Lev's
jaw falls), I do hereby freely forgive him his six years
boarding and lodging, and, furthermore, make him a present
of my two old negroes, Ben and Dinah."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;cussed old screw," bawls old Williams.</p>

<p>"The infernal, double and twisted, mean, contemptible,
miserable old scoundrel!" cries poor Lev, foaming with
virtuous indignation, and swinging his doubled up fists.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;you&mdash;you cussed, do-less, good for nothing,
hypocritical skunk, you," yells old Williams, shaking his
bony fingers in poor Lev's face, the neighbors grinning
from ear to ear, "to humbug me, my wife, my Polly, in this
yer way. Now clear yourself&mdash;take them old niggers, don't
leave 'em here for the crows to eat&mdash;clear yourself!"</p>

<p>Lev Smith sneaks off like a kill-sheep dog, leaving old
Ben and Dinah to the tender mercies of a quite miserable
and equally wretched neighborhood. Polly Williams didn't
"take on" much about the matter, but in the course of a
few weeks took another venture in love's lottery, and&mdash;was
married. Poor Lev Smith returned to the scenes of his
childhood, a wiser and a poorer man.</p>

<h2><a name="of_a_Mover" id="of_a_Mover"></a>The Troubles of a Mover.</h2>


<p>"Mr. Flash in?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Flash? Don't know any such person, my son."</p>

<p>"Why, he lives here!" continued the boy.</p>

<p>"Guess not, my son; I live here."</p>

<p>"Well, this is the house, for I brought the things here."</p>

<p>"What things?" says our friend, Flannigan.</p>

<p>"Why, the door mat, the brooms, buckets and brushes,"
says little breeches.</p>

<p>Flannigan looks vacantly at his own door mat, for a minute,
then says he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come in my man, I'll see if any such articles have come
here, for us."</p>

<p>The boy walks into the hall, amid the barricades of yet
unplaced household effects&mdash;for Flannigan had just moved
in&mdash;and Flannigan calls for Mrs. F. The lady appears and
denies all knowledge of any such purchases, or reception
of buckets, brooms, and little breeches clears out.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour, a violent jerk at the bell announces
another customer. Flannigan being at work in
the parlor, answers the call; he opens the door, and there
stands "a greasy citizen."</p>

<p>"Goo' mornin'. Mr. Flash in?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Flash? I don't know him, sir."</p>

<p>"You don't?" says the "greasy citizen." "He lives
here, got this bill agin him, thirty-four dollars, ten cents,
per-visions."</p>

<p>"I live here, sir; my name's Flannigan, I don't know
you, or owe you, of course!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a pooty spot o' work, <i>any how</i>;" growls
our greasy citizen, crumpling up his bill. "Where's Flash?"</p>

<p>"I can't possibly say," says Flannigan.</p>

<p>"You can't?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Don't know where he's gone to?" growls the butcher.</p>

<p>"No more than the man in the moon!"</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't goin' to dodge <i>me</i>, in no sich a way,"
says the butcher. "I'll find him, if it costs me a bullock,
you may tell him so!&mdash;for <i>me!</i>" growls the butcher.</p>

<p>"Tell him yourself, sir; I've nothing to do with the fellow,
don't know him from Adam, as I've already told <i>you</i>,"
says Flannigan, closing the door&mdash;the "greasy citizen"
walking down the steps muttering thoughts that breathe and
words that burn!</p>

<p>Flannigan had just elevated himself upon the top of the
centre table, to hang up Mrs. F.'s portrait upon the parlor
wall, when another ring was heard of the bell. He called
to his little daughter to open the door and see what was wanted.</p>

<p>"Is your fadder in, ah?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'll call him," says the child, but before she
could reach the parlor, a burly Dutch baker marches in.</p>

<p>"Goot mornin', I bro't de <i>pills</i> in."</p>

<p>"Pills?" says Flannigan.</p>

<p>"Yaw, for de prets," continues the baker; "nine tollars
foof'ey cents. I vos heert you was movin', so I tink maybees
you was run away."</p>

<p>"Mistake, sir, I don't owe you a cent; never bought
bread of you!"</p>

<p>"<i>Vaw's!</i> Tonner a' blitzen!&mdash;don't owes me!"</p>

<p>"Not a cent!" says Flannigan, standing&mdash;hammer in
hand, upon the top of the table.</p>

<p>"<i>Vaw's!</i> you goin' thrun away and sheet me, <i>ah</i>?"</p>

<p>"Look here, my friend, you are under a mistake. I've
just moved in here, my name's Flannigan, you never saw
me before, and of course I never dealt with you!&mdash;don't
you see?"</p>

<p>"Tonner a' blitzen!" cries the enraged baker, "I see vat
you vant, to sheet me out mine preet, you raskills&mdash;I go
fetch the con-stabl's, de shudge, de sher'ffs, and I have
mine mon-ney in mine hands!" and off rushes the enraged
man of dough, upsetting the various small articles piled up
on the bureau in the hall&mdash;by <i>wanging</i> to the door.</p>

<p>Poor Flannigan felt quite "put out;" he came very near
dashing his hammer at the Dutchman's head, but hoping
there was an end to the annoyances he kept at work, until
another ring of the bell announced another call. The Irish
girl went to the door; Flannigan listens&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Flash in?"</p>

<p>"Yees!" says Biddy, supposing Flash and Flannigan
was the same in Dutch. "Would yees come in, sir," and
in comes the young man.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," quoth he; "I've called as you requested
sir, with the bill of that china set, &amp;c."</p>

<p>"Mistake, sir&mdash;I've bought no china set, lately," says Flannigan.</p>

<p>"Isn't your name Flash, sir!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, my name's <i>Flannigan</i>. I've just moved here."</p>

<p>"Indeed," says the clerk. "Well, sir, where has Flash
gone to, do you know."</p>

<p>"Gone to be hanged! I trust, for I've been bothered all
this morning by persons that scoundrel appears to owe.
He moved out of here, day before yesterday; I took his
unexpired term of the lease of this dwelling, having noticed
it advertised, gave the fellow a bonus for his lease, and he
cleared for California, I believe."</p>

<p>This concise statement appeared to satisfy the clerk that
his "firm" was <i>done</i>, and the young man and <i>his</i> bill
stepped out. Another <i>ring</i>, and Flannigan opens the door;
two men wanted to see Mr. Flash; he had been buying some
tin-ware of one, and the other he owed for putting up a
fire range in the building, and which range and accoutrements
poor Flannigan had bought for twenty-five dollars,
cash down! These gentlemen felt very vindictive, of course,
and hinted awful strong that Flannigan was privy to Flash's
movements; and a great deal more, until Flannigan losing
his patience, and then his temper, ordered the men to vamose!&mdash;they
did, giving poor Flannigan a "good blessing"
as they walked away!</p>

<p>The family was about to sit down to a "made-up dinner"
in the back parlor, when the bell rang; the Irish girl
answered the call, and returned with a bill of sundry groceries,
handed in by a man at the door.</p>

<p>"Tell him Mr. Flash has gone&mdash;left&mdash;don't know him,
and don't want to know him, or have any thing to do with
him or his bill!"</p>

<p>The girl carried back the bill; presently Flannigan hears
a <i>muss</i> in the hall, he gets up and goes out; there was
Biddy and the grocer's man in a high dispute. Biddy&mdash;"true
to her instinct," had made a bull of her message by
telling the man her master didn't know him; go to the
divil wid his bill! Flannigan managed to pacify the man,
and give him to understand that Mr. Flash was gone to
parts unknown, and&mdash;the grocer, in common with bakers,
butchers, tinners and china dealers&mdash;were <i>done!</i></p>

<p>But now came the tug of war; two "colored ladies"
made their appearance, for a small bill of seven dollars,
for washing and ironing the dickeys and fine linen of the Flashes.</p>

<p>"An' de fac <i>am</i>," says the one, "we's bound to hab de
money, <i>shuah!</i>"</p>

<p>It did not seem to <i>take</i> when Flannigan informed his
colored friends that they were surely <i>done</i>, as their debtor
had "cut his lucky" and gone!</p>

<p>The darkies felt inclined to be <i>sassy</i>, and Flannigan
closed the door, ordering them to create a vacancy by
clearing out, and just as he closed the door, ring goes
the bell!</p>

<p>"Be gor," says a brawny "adopted citizen," planting
his brogan upon the sill, as Flannigan opened the door&mdash;"I've
come wid me <i>coz</i>-zin to git her wages, ye's owin' her!"</p>

<p>"Me? Owe you?" cries poor Flannigan.</p>

<p>"<i>Igh!</i>" says Paddy, trying to push his way into the hall.</p>

<p>"Stand back, you scoundrel!" cries Flannigan.</p>

<p>"<i>Scoun-thril!</i>" roars the outraged "adopted citizen."</p>

<p>"Stand back, you infernal ruffian!" exclaims Flannigan,
as Paddy makes a rush to grab him.</p>

<p>"Give me me coz-zin's wages, ye&mdash;ye&mdash;" but here his oration
drew towards a close, for Flannigan, no longer able to
recognise virtue in forbearance, opened the door and planting
his own huge fist between the <i>ogle-factories</i> of Paddy,
knocked him as stiff as a bull beef! Falling, Paddy carried
away his red-faced burly coz-zin, and the twain tumbling
upon the two negro women who were still at the
bottom of the steps, dilating, to any number of lookers-on,
upon the rascality of poor Flannigan in gouging them out
of their washing bill, down went the white spirits and
black, all in a lump.</p>

<p>Here was a row! A mob gathered; "the people in that
house" were denounced in all manner of ways, the negroes
screamed, the Irish roared, the Dutch baker came up with
a police-man to arrest Flannigan for stealing his bread!
And soon the butcher arrived with another officer to seize
the goods of Flash, supposed to be in the house&mdash;ready to
be taken away!</p>

<p>Such a double and twisted uproar in Dutch, Irish, Ethiopian
and natural Yankee, was terrific!</p>

<p>Mrs. F. fainted, the children screamed, and poor Flannigan
was carried to the police office to answer half a cord
of "charges," and reached home near sundown, quite exhausted,
and his wallet bled for "costs," fines, &amp;c., some
$20. Poor Flannigan moved again; the house had such a
"bad name," he couldn't stay in it.</p>

<h2><a name="the_Astor_House" id="the_Astor_House"></a>How it's Done at the Astor House.</h2>


<p>People often wonder how a man can manage to drink
up his salary in liquor, provided it is sufficient to buy
a gallon of the very best ardent every day in the year.
How a fortune can be drank up, or drank down, by the
possessor, is still a greater poser to the unsophisticated.
Now, to be sure, a man who confines himself, in his potations,
to fourpenny drinks of small beer, Columbian whiskey,
or even that detestable stuff, by courtesy or custom called
<i>French brandy</i>,&mdash;which, in fact, is generally aquafortis,
corrosive sublimate, cochineal, logwood, and whiskey,&mdash;and
don't happen to know too many drouthy cronies, may
make a very long lane of it; but it's the easiest thing in
the world to swallow a snug salary, income, mortgages, live
stock, and real estate, when you know how it's done.</p>

<p>Managing a theatre, publishing a newspaper, or keeping
trained dogs or trotting horses, don't hardly begin to phlebotomize
purse and reputation, like drinking.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said a gay Southern blood, to a famed "tooth
doctor," "look into my mouth."</p>

<p>"I can't see any thing there, sir," says the tooth puller.</p>

<p>"Can't? Well, that's deuced strange. Why, sir, look
again; you see nothing!"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir!"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," says the young planter, "it's most astonishing,
for I've just finished swallowing&mdash;<i>three hundred negroes
and two cotton plantations!</i>"</p>

<p>Four young bucks met, some years ago, in a fashionable
drinking saloon in Cincinnati. It was one of the most elegant
drinking establishments in that part of the country.
The young chaps belonged over in Kentucky&mdash;daddies rich,
and they didn't care a snap! says they, let's have a spree!
The "sham" came in, and they went at it; giving that a
fair trial, they took a turn at sherry, hock, and a sample of
all the most expensive stuffs the proprietors had on hand.
Getting fuddled, they got uproarious; they kicked over the
tables and knocked down the waiters. The landlord, not
exactly appreciating that sort of "going on," remonstrated,
and was met by an array of pistols and knives. Mad and
furious, the young chaps made a general onslaught on the
people present, who "dug out" very quick, leaving the
bacchanalians to their glory; whereupon, they fell to and
fired their pistols into the mirrors, paintings, chandeliers,
&amp;c. Of course the watchmen came in, about the time the
young gentlemen finished their youthful indiscretions, and
after the usual battering and banging of the now almost
inanimate bodies of the quartette, landed them in the calaboose.
Next day they settled their bills, and it cost them
about $2200! It was rather an expensive lesson, but it's
altogether probable that they haven't forgotten a letter of
it yet.</p>

<p>A small party of country merchants, traders, &amp;c., were
cruising around New York, one evening, seeing the lions,
and their cicerone,&mdash;by the way, a "native" who knew what
<i>was</i> what,&mdash;took them up Broadway, and as they passed
the Astor House, says one of the strangers:</p>

<p>"Smith, what's this thunderin' big house?"</p>

<p>"O, ah, yes, this," says the cicerone, Smith, "<i>this</i>, boys, is
a great tavern, fine place to get a drink."</p>

<p>"Well, be hooky, let's all go in."</p>

<p>In they all went; taking a private room or small side
parlor, the country gents requested Smith to do the talking
and order in the liquor. Smith called for a bill of fare,
upon which are "invoiced" more "sorts" and harder named
wines and <i>liquors</i> than could be committed to memory in a week.</p>

<p>"That's it," says Smith, marking a bill of fare, and handing
it to the servant, "that's it&mdash;two bottles, bring 'em up."</p>

<p>Up came the wine; it was, of course, elegant. The
country gents froze to it. They had never tasted such stuff
before, in all their born days!</p>

<p>"Look a here, mister," says one of the "business men,"
"got eny more uv that wine?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, sir!" says the servant.</p>

<p>"Well, fetch it in."</p>

<p>"Two bottles, sir?"</p>

<p>"Two ganders! No, bring in six bottles!&mdash;I can go two
on 'em myself," says the country gent.</p>

<p>The servant delivered his message at the bar, and after
a few grimaces and whispering, the servant and one of the
bar-keepers, or clerks, carried up the wine. Says the clerk,
whispering to Smith, whom he slightly knew:</p>

<p>"Smith, do you know the price of this wine?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," says Smith; "here it's invoiced on the
catalogue, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"O, very well," says the clerk, about to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" says one of the merry country gents, "don't
snake your handsome countenance off so quick; do yer want
us to fork rite up fur these drinks?" hauling out his wallet.</p>

<p>"No, yer don't," says another, hauling out his change.</p>

<p>"My treat, if you please, boys," says the third, pulling out
a handful of small change. "I asked the party in, an' I pay
for what licker we drink&mdash;be thunder!"</p>

<p>In the midst of their enthusiasm, the clerk observed it
was of no importance just then&mdash;the bill would be presented
when they got through. This was satisfactory, and the
party went on finishing their wine, smoking, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"S'pose we have some rale sham-paigne, boys?" says one
of the gents, beginning to feel his oats, some!</p>

<p>"Agreed!" says the rest. Two bottles of the best "<i>sham</i>"
in "the tavern" were called for, and which the party drank
with great gusto.</p>

<p>"Now," says one of them, "let's go to the the-ater, or
some other place where there's a show goin' on. Here, you,
mister,"&mdash;to the servant,&mdash;"go fetch in the landlord."</p>

<p>"The landlord, sur?" says Pat, the servant, in some
doubts as to the meaning of the phrase.</p>

<p>"Ay, landlord&mdash;or that chap that was in here just now;
tell him to fetch in the bill. Ah, here you are, old feller;
well, what's the damages?" asks the gent, so ambitious of
putting the party through, and hauling out a handful of
keys, silver and coppers, to do it with.</p>

<p>"Eight bottles of that old flim-flam-di-rip-rap," pronouncing
one of those fancy gamboge titles found upon an
Astor House catalogue, "<i>ninety-six dollars&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>"What?" gasped the country gent, gathering up his small
change, that he had began to sort out on the table.</p>

<p>"And two bottles of 'Shreider,' and cigars&mdash;seven
dollars," coolly continued the bar-clerk; "one hundred and
three dollars."</p>

<p>"<i>A hundred and three thunder&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A hundred and three dollars!</span>" cried the country
gents, in one breath, all starting to their feet, and putting
on their hats.</p>

<p>The clerk explained it, clear as mud; the trio "spudged
up" the amount, looked very sober, and walked out.</p>

<p>"Come, boys," said Smith, "let's go to the theatre."</p>

<p>"Guess not," says "the boys." "B'lieve we'll go home for
to-night, Mr. Smith." And they made for their lodgings.</p>

<p>If those country gents were asked, when they got home,
any particulars about the "elephant," they'd probably hint
something about getting a glimpse of him at the Astor House.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Advertisement" id="The_Advertisement"></a>The Advertisement.</h2>


<p>Sit down for a moment, we will not detain you long, our
story will interest you, we are sure, for it is most commendable,
brief, and&mdash;singularly true.</p>

<p>A poor widow, in the city of Philadelphia, was the
mother of three pretty children, orphans of a ship-builder,
who lost his life in the corvette Kensington, a naval vessel,
built in Kensington for one of the South American republics,
and launched in 1826. The South Americans
being short of funds, the Kensington, after years of delay,
was sold to the emperor of all the Russias, and sailed for
Constradt in 1830. Some forty of the carpenters, who had
built the vessel, went out in her; she had immense, but
symmetrical spars&mdash;carried vast clouds of canvass&mdash;was
caught off Cape Henlopen in a squall&mdash;her spars came thundering
to the deck, and poor Glenn, the ship builder, was
among the slain.</p>

<p>The widow was allowed but a brief time to mourn for
the departed; pinching poverty was at her door; upon her
own exertions now devolved the care and toil of rearing
her three children. Cynthia, the eldest, was a pretty brunette,
of thirteen; the neighbors thought Cynthia could
"go out to work;" the next eldest, Martin, a fine, sturdy
and intelligent boy, could go to a trade; and the youngest,
Rosa, one of the most beautiful, blue-eyed, blonde little
girls of seven years, poetical fancy ever realized, "the
neighbors thought," ought to be <i>given</i> to somebody, to
raise. The mother was but a feeble woman; it would be a
task for her to obtain her own living, they thought; and
so, kind, generous souls, with that peculiar readiness with
which disinterested friends console or advise the unfortunate,
"the neighbors" became very eloquent and argumentative.
But though the mother's hands were weak, her heart was
strong, and her love for her children still stronger.</p>

<p>It is rather a singular trait in the human character, it
appears to us, that people possessing the ordinary attributes
of sane Christians, should so readily advise others to
attempt, or do, that from which <i>they</i> would instinctively
recoil; the mass of Widow Glenn's advisers might have
been far more serviceable to her, by contributing their mites
towards preserving the unity of her little and precious
family, than thus savagely advising its disbanding.</p>

<p>Newspapers, at this day, were far less numerous very
expensive, and circulated to a very limited degree, indeed.
But the widow took a paper, a family, weekly journal; and
while casting her vacant eye over the columns, at the close
of a Saturday eve, after a severe week's toil for the bread
her little and precious ones had eaten, the widow's attention
was called to an advertisement, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">A Housekeeper Wanted.</span>&mdash;An elderly gentleman desires
a middle-aged, pleasantly-disposed, tidy and industrious
American woman, to take charge and conduct the
domestic affairs of his household. A reasonable compensation
allowed. Good reference required, <i>the applicant to
have no incumbrances</i>. Apply at this office, for the address, &amp;c."</p></div>

<p>The eager smile, that seemed to warm the wan features
of the widow, as she glanced over the advertisement, was
dimmed and darkened, as the shining river of summer is
shadowed by the heavy passing cloud, when she came to
the chilling words&mdash;<i>the applicant to have no incumbrances</i>.</p>

<p>"No incumbrances," moaned the widow, "shall none but
God deign to smile or have mercy on the helpless orphans;
are they to be feared, shunned, hated, because helpless?
Must they perish&mdash;die with me alone&mdash;struggling against
our woes, poverty, wretchedness? No! I know there is a
God, he is good, powerful, merciful; he will turn the hearts
of some towards the widow and the orphan; and though
basilisk-like words warn me to hope not, I will apply&mdash;I
will attempt to win attention, work, slave, toil, toil, toil,
until my poor hands shall wear to the bone, and my eyes
no longer do their office&mdash;if he will only have mercy, pity
for my poor, poor orphans&mdash;God bless them!" and in melting
tenderness and emotion, the poor woman dropped her
face upon her lap and wept&mdash;her tears were the showers of
hope, to the almost parched soil of her heart, and as the
gentle dews of heaven fall to the earth, so fell the widow's
tears in balmy freshness upon her visions of a brighter
something&mdash;in the future.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the evening; her children slept; the
poor woman put on her bonnet and shawl, and started at
once for the office of the <i>news</i>paper. The publisher was
just closing his sanctum, but he gave the information the
widow required, and favorably impressed with Mrs. Glenn's
appearance and manner, the publisher, a quaker, interrogated
her on various points of her present condition, prospects,
&amp;c.; and observed, that but for her children, he had
no doubt of the widow's suiting the old man exactly.</p>

<p>"But thee must not be neglected, or discarded from
honest industry, because of thy responsibilities, which God
hath given thee," said the quaker. "If thy lad is stout of
his age, and a good boy, I will provide for him; he may
learn our business, and be off thy charge, and thee may be
enabled to keep thy two female children about thee."</p>

<p>On the following Monday, the widow signified her intention
of writing a few lines as an applicant for the situation
of housekeeper, and afterwards to consult with the
publisher in regard to her boy, Martin, and then bidding
the courteous quaker farewell, she sought her humble
domicil, with a much lighter heart than she had lately carried
from her distressed and lonely home.</p>

<p>In an ancient part of the Quaker city, facing the broad
and beautiful Delaware river, stood a venerable mansion;
but few of this class now remain in Philadelphia, and the
one of which we now speak, but recently passed away, in
the great conflagration that visited the city in 1850. In
this substantial and stately brick edifice, lived one of the
wealthy and retired ship brokers of Quakerdom. He was
very wealthy, very eccentric, very good-hearted, but passionate,
plethoric, gouty, and seventy years of age. Mr.
Job Carson had lived long and seen much; he had been so
engrossed in clearing his fortune, that from twenty-five to
forty, he had not bethought him of that almost indispensable
appendage to a man's comfort in this world&mdash;a wife. He
was the next ten years considering the matter over, and
then, having built and furnished himself a costly mansion,
which he peopled with servants, headed by a maiden sister
as housekeeper, Job thought, upon the whole&mdash;to which his
sister added her strong consent&mdash;that matrimony would
greatly increase his cares, and perhaps add more <i>noise</i> and
confusion to his household, than it might counterbalance or
offset by probable comfort in "wedded happiness," so
temptingly set forth to old bachelors.</p>

<p>"No," said Job, at fifty, "I'll not marry, not trade off
my single blessedness yet; at least, there's time enough,
there's women enough; I'm young, hale, hearty, in the
prime of life; no, I'll not give up the ship to woman yet."</p>

<p>Another ten years rolled along, and the thing turned up
in the retired merchant's mind again&mdash;he was now sixty,
and one, at least, of the objections to his entering the
wedded state, removed&mdash;for a man at sixty is scarcely too
young to marry, surely.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's all up," quoth Job Carson. "I'm spoiled now.
I've had my own way so long, I could not think of surrendering
to petticoats, turning my house into a nursery, and
turning my back on the joys, quiet and comforts of bachelorhood.
No, no, Job Carson&mdash;matrimony be hanged.
You'll none of it." And so ten years more passed&mdash;now
age and luxury do their work.</p>

<p>"O, that infernal twinge in my toe. <i>O</i>, there it is again&mdash;hang
the goat, it can't be gout. Dr. Bleedem swears I'm
getting the gout. Blockhead&mdash;none of my kith or kin ever
had such an infernal complaint. O, ah-h-h, that infernal
window must be sand-bagged, given me this pain in the
back, and&mdash;Banquo! Where the deuce is that nigger&mdash;Banquo-o-o!"</p>

<p>"Yis, massa, here I is," said a good-natured, fat, black
and sleek-looking old darkey, poking his shining, grinning
face into the old gentleman's study, sitting, playing or
smoking room.</p>

<p>"Here you are? Where? You black sarpint, come here;
go to Jackplane, the carpenter, and tell him to come here
and make my sashes tight, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Yis, massa, dem's 'em; I'se off."</p>

<p>"No, you ain't&mdash;come here, Banquo, you woolly son of
Congo, you; go open my liquor case, bring the brandy and
some cool water. There, now clear yourself."</p>

<p>"Yis, massa, I'se gone, dis time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you ain't, come back; go to old Joe Winepipes,
and tell him I send my compliments to him, and if he wants
to continue that game of chess, let him come over this
afternoon, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Yis, massa, dem's 'em, I'se gone dis time&mdash;<i>shuah!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, away with you."</p>

<p>Old Job Carson was yet a rugged looking old gentleman.
He had survived nearly all his "blood, kith and kin;" his
sister had paid the last debt of nature some months before,
and in hopes of finding some one to fill her station, in his
domestic concerns, his advertisement had appeared in the
<i>Weekly Bulletin</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah, me, it's no use crying about spilt milk," sighed the
old gent over his glass. "I suppose I've been a fool; out-lived
everybody, everything useful to me. Made a fortune
<i>first</i>, nobody to spend it <i>last</i>. Yes, yes," continued the
old man, in a thoughtful strain, "old Job Carson will soon
slip off the handle; 'poor old devil,' some bloodsucker may
say, as he grabs Job's worldly effects, 'he's gone, had a
hard scrabble to get together these things, and now, we'll
pick his bones.' Well, let 'em, let 'em; serves me right;
ought to have known it before, but blast and rot 'em, if
they only enjoy the pillage as much as I did the struggles
to keep it together, why, a&mdash;it will be about an even thing
with us, after all."</p>

<p>"Yis, massa, here I is," chuckled Banquo, again putting
his black bullet pate in at the door.</p>

<p>"You are, eh? Well, clear yourself&mdash;no, come back; go
down to Oatmeal's store, and tell him to let old Mrs.
Dougherty, and the old blind man, and the sailor's wife,
and&mdash;and&mdash;the rest of them, have their groceries, again,
this week&mdash;only another week, mind, for I'm not going to
support the whole neighborhood any longer&mdash;tell him so."</p>

<p>"Yis, massa, I'se gone."</p>

<p>"Wait, come here, Banquo; well, never mind&mdash;clear out."</p>

<p>But Banquo returned in a moment, saying:</p>

<p>"Dar's a lady at the doo-ah, sah; says she wants to see
you, sah, 'bout 'ticlar business, sah."</p>

<p>"Is, eh? Well, call her into the parlor, I'll be down&mdash;ah-h,
that infernal <i>twinge</i> again, ah-h-h-h, ah-h! What a
stupid ass a man is to hang around in this world until he's
a nuisance to himself and every body else!" grunted old
Job, as he groped his way down stairs, and into the parlor.</p>

<p><a name='Pg_393' id='Pg_393'></a>"Good morning, ma'am," said he, as he confronted the
widow, who, in the utmost taste of simple neatness, had
arranged her spare dress, to meet the umpire of her future fate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glenn respectfully acknowledged the salutation, and
at once opened her business to the bluff old man.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I'm a poor, unfortunate creature, ma'am; I'm
nothing, nobody, any more. I want somebody to see that
I'm not robbed, or poisoned, and that I may have a bed to
lie upon, and a clean piece of linen to my back occasionally,
and a&mdash;that's all I want, ma'am."</p>

<p>The widow feigned to hope she knew the duties of a
housekeeper, and situated as she was, it was a labor of love
to work&mdash;toil, for those misfortune had placed in her charge.</p>

<p>"Eh? what's that&mdash;haven't got <i>incumbrances</i>, have you, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I have three children, sir," meekly said the widow.</p>

<p>"Three children?" gruffly responded the old gentleman;
"ah, umph, what business have you, ma'am, with three children?"</p>

</div>

<p>The widow, not apparently able to answer such a poser,
the old gentleman continued:</p>

<p>"Poor widows, poor people of any kind, have no business
with <i>incumbrances</i>, ma'am; no excuse at all, ma'am,
for 'em."</p>

<p>"So, alas!" said Mrs. Glenn, "I find the world too&mdash;too
much inclined to reason; but I shall trust to the mercy
and providence of the Lord, if denied the kind feelings of mortals."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, yes, that's it, ma'am; it's all very fine, ma'am;
but too many poor, foolish creatures get themselves in a
scrape, then depend upon the Lord to help 'em out. This
shifting the responsibility to the shoulders of the Lord isn't
right. I don't wonder the Lord shuts his ears to half he's
asked to do, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I thought I would <i>call</i>, though I feared my
children would be an objection to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;I don't want incumbrances, ma'am."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;I a&mdash;"&mdash;the widow's heart was too full for utterance;
she moved towards the door. "Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>"Stop, come back, ma'am, sit down; it's a pity&mdash;you've
no business, ma'am, as I said before, to have incumbrances,
when you haven't got any visible means of support. Now,
if you only had one, one incumbrance&mdash;and that you'd no
business to have"&mdash;said the old gent, doggedly, tapping an
antique tortoise-shell snuff box, and applying "the pungent
grains of titillating dust," as Pope observes, to his
proboscis, "if you had only <i>one</i> incumbrance&mdash;but you've
got a house full, ma'am."</p>

<p>"No, sir, only three!" answered widow Glenn.</p>

<p>"Three, only three? God bless me, ma'am, I wouldn't
be a poor woman with two&mdash;no, with one incumbrance at
my petticoat tails&mdash;for the biggest ship and cargo old Steve
Girard ever owned, ma'am."</p>

<p>"I might," meekly said the widow, "put my son with
the printer, sir; he has offered to take my poor boy."</p>

<p>"Two girls and a boy?" inquiringly asked the old gent,
applying the dust, and manipulating his box. "How old?
Eldest thirteen, eh?&mdash;boy eleven, and the youngest seven,
eh?" and working a traverse, or solving some problematic
point, Job Carson stuck his hands under his morning gown,
and strode over the floor; after a few evolutions of the kind,
he stopped&mdash;fumbled in a drawer of a secretary, and placing
a ten dollar note in the widow's hand, he said:</p>

<p>"There, ma'am; I don't know that I shall want you, but
to-morrow morning, if you have time, from other and more
important business, call in, bring your children with you;
good morning, ma'am&mdash;Banquo!"</p>

<p>"Yis, sah; I'se heah."</p>

<p>"Show the lady out&mdash;good morning, ma'am, good morning."</p>

<p>"I like that woman's looks," said old Job, continuing
his walk; "she's plain and tidy; she's industrious, I'll warrant;
if she only hadn't that raft of <i>incumbrances</i>; what
do these people have incumbrances for, anyway?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady at the doo-ah, sah," said Banquo.</p>

<p>"Show her in. Good morning, ma'am; Banquo, a seat
for the lady; yes, ma'am, I did; I want a housekeeper. I
advertised for one. How many servants do I keep? Well,
ma'am, I keep as many as I want. Have visitors? Of
course I have. What and where are <i>my rooms</i>? Why,
madam, I own the house, every brick and lath in it. I go
to bed, and get up, and go round; come in and out, when I
feel like it. What church do I worship in? I've assisted
in <i>building</i> a number, own a half of one, and a third of
several; but, ma'am, between you and I&mdash;I don't want to
be rude to a lady, ma'am, but I <i>do</i> think, this examination
ain't to my liking&mdash;you don't think the place would suit
you, eh? Well, I think <i>your ladyship</i> wouldn't suit <i>me</i>,
ma'am, so I'll bid your ladyship good morning," said old
Job, bowing very obsequiously to the stiff-starched and
acrimonious dame, who, returning the old gentleman's <i>bow</i>
with the same "high pressure" order, seized her skirts in
one hand, and agitating her fan with the other, she stepped
out, or <i>finikined</i> along to the hall door, and as Banquo
flew around, and put on the <i>extras</i> to let her ladyship out,
she gave the darkey a pat on the head with her fan, and
looking crab-apples at the poor negro, she rushed down the
steps and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Tank you, ma'am; come again, eb you please&mdash;of'n!"
said the pouting negro.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah; here's nudder lady, sah," says Banquo, ushering
in a rather ruddy, jolly-looking and perfectly-at-home
daughter of the "gim o' the sae." The old gentleman
eyed her liberal proportions; consulting his snuff-box, he
answered "yes" to the woman's inquiry, if <i>he</i> was the gintleman
wanting the housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Did you read my advertisement, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Me rade it? Not I, faix. Mr. Mullony, our landlord,
was saying till us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you married, too?"</p>

<p>"Married <i>two</i>? Do I look like a woman as would marry
two? No, <i>sur</i>; I'm a dacent woman, sur; my name is
Hannah Geaughey, Jimmy Geaughey's my husband, sur;
he, poor man, wrought in the board-yard till he was <i>sun
sthruck</i>, by manes of falling from a cuart, sur."</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am, that will do, I'm sorry for your husband&mdash;one
dollar, there it is; you wouldn't suit me at all; good
morning, ma'am. Banquo, show the good woman to the door."</p>

<p>"But, sur, I want the place!"</p>

<p>"I don't want <i>you</i>&mdash;good morning."</p>

<p>"Dis way, ma'am," said Banquo, marshalling the woman
to the hall.</p>

<p>"Stand away, ye nager; it's your masther I'm spakin' wid."</p>

<p>"Go along, go along, woman, go, go, <i>go!</i>" roared the
old gent.</p>

<p>"But, as I was saying, Mr. Mullony said&mdash;says he&mdash;who
the divil you push'n, you black nager?" said the woman,
grabbing Banquo's woolly top-knot.</p>

<p>"Dis way, ma'am," persevered Banquo, quartering towards
the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mullony was sayin', sur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dis way, ma'am," continued the darkey, crowding Mrs.
Geaughey, while his master was gesticulating furiously to
keep on <i>crowding</i> her. Finally, Banquo vanquished the
Irish woman, and received orders from his master to admit
no more applicants&mdash;the place was filled.
</p><p>
That afternoon, old Captain Winepipes&mdash;a retired merchant
and ship-master, an old bachelor, too, who was in the
habit of exchanging visits with Job Carson, sipping brandy
and water, talking over old times and playing chess&mdash;came
to finish a litigated game, and Job and he discussed the
matter of taking care of the widow and children of the
dead ship-builder. At length, it was settled that, if the
second interview with the widow, and an exhibition of her
children, proved satisfactory to Job Carson, he should take
them in; if found more than Job could attend to&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why a&mdash;I'll go you halves, Job," said Captain Winepipes.</p>

<p>Next day, Widow Glenn and her pretty children appeared
at the door of Carson's mansion; and Banquo, full
of pleasant anticipations, ushered them into the retired
merchant's presence.</p>

<p>It was evident, at the first glance the old gentleman gave
the group, that the battle was more than half won.</p>

<p>"Fine boy, that; come here, sir&mdash;eleven years of age,
eh? Your name's Martin&mdash;Martin Glenn, eh? Well,
Martin, my lad, you've got a big world before you&mdash;a fussing,
fuming world, not worth finding out, not worth the
powder that would blow it up. You've got to take your
position in the ranks, too, mean and contemptible as they
are; but you may make a good man; if the world don't
benefit you, why a&mdash;you can benefit it; that's the way I've
done&mdash;been obliged to do it, ain't sorry for it, neither,"
said the old man, with evident emotion.</p>

<p>"Your name is Cynthia, eh? And you are a fine grown
girl for your age, surely. Cynthia, you'll soon be capable
of 'keeping house,' too; you've got a world before you,
too, my dear; a wicked, scandalous world; a world full of
deceit and <i>misery</i>&mdash;look at your mother, look at me! Ah,
well, it's all our own fault; yours, madam, for having these&mdash;these
<i>incumbrances</i>, and mine, poor devil&mdash;for not having
'em. Cynthia, you're a fine girl; a good girl, I know.
Ah, here's mamma's pet, I suppose; Rose Glenn, very
pretty name, pretty girl, too, very pretty. Lips and cheeks
like cherries, eyes brighter than Brazil diamonds. Ma'am,
you've got great treasures here; a man must be a stupid ass
to call these <i>incumbrances</i>. They are jewels of inestimable
value. What's my filthy bank accounts, dollars and cents,
houses, goods and chattels, that fire may destroy, and
thieves steal&mdash;to these blessings that&mdash;that God has given
the lone widow to strengthen her&mdash;cheer her in the dark
path of life? God is great, generous, and just; I see it
now, plainer than I ever did before. Banquo!"</p>

<p>"Yis'r, I'se here, massa."</p>

<p>"Go tell Counsellor Prime to call on me immediately;
tell Captain Winepipes to come over&mdash;I want to see him.
I'm going to make a fool of myself, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah, I'se gone; gorry, I <ins title="gues">guess</ins> dere's suffin gwoin to
happen to dat lady and dem chil'ns&mdash;shuah!" said Banquo,
rushing out of the house.</p>

<p>The fate of the ship-builder's family was fixed. Job
Carson proposed&mdash;and the widow, of course, consented&mdash;that
Martin Glenn should become the adopted son of the old
gentleman, Job Carson; and that he should choose a trade
or profession, which he should then, or later, learn, making
the old gentleman's house as much his home as circumstances
would permit; the two girls were to remain under
the same roof with the mother, who was at once installed as
housekeeper for the bluff and generous old gentleman.</p>

<p>Old Captain Winepipes insisted on a share in the settlement,
to wit: that both girls should be educated at his expense,
which was finally acceded to, adding, that in case
he&mdash;Captain Joseph Winepipes&mdash;should live to see Rose
Glenn a bride, he should provide for her wedding, and give
her a dowry.</p>

<p>"Set that down in black and white, Mr. Prime," said
Job, "and that I, Job Carson, do agree, should I live to
see Cynthia Glenn a wife, to give her a comfortable start
in the world&mdash;set that down, for I will do it, yes, I will,"
said the old gent, with an emphatic rap on his snuff-box.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Ten years passed away; Captain Winepipes has paid the
debt of nature; he did not live to see Rose Glenn a wife;
but, nevertheless, he left a clause in his will, that fully carried
out his expressed intentions when Rose did marry,
some two years after she arrived at the age of sweet seventeen.
Martin Glenn Carson graduated in the printing
office, and very recently filled one of the most important
stations in the judiciary of Illinois, as well as a chivalrous
part in the recent war with Mexico. Cynthia was wedded
to a well known member of the Philadelphia bar, an event
that Job Carson barely lived to see, and, as he agreed to,
donated a sum, quite munificent, towards making things
agreeable in the progress of her married life. Widow Glenn
remained a faithful servant and friend to the old merchant,
and, upon his death, she became heir to the family mansion,
and means to keep it up at the usual bountiful rate. Large
bequests were made in Job Carson's will, to charitable institutes,
but the bulk of his fortune fell to his adopted son,
Martin, who proved not unworthy of his good fortune.
Banquo ended his days in the service of the widow, who
had cause for and took pleasure in blessing the vehicle that
conveyed to herself and orphans their rare good fortune, in
guise of a <span class="smcap">newspaper advertisement</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="Fortune-Hunters_Life" id="Fortune-Hunters_Life"></a>Incidents in a Fortune-Hunter's Life.</h2>


<p>We do not now recollect what philosopher it was
who said, "it's no disgrace to be poor, but it's
often confoundedly unhandy!" But, we have little or no
sympathy for poor folks, who, ashamed of their poverty,
make as many and tortuous writhings to escape its inconveniences,
as though it was "against the law" to be poor.
It is the cause of incalculable human misery, to <i>seem</i> what
we are <i>not</i>; to appear beyond <i>want</i>&mdash;yea, even in affluence
and comfort, when the belly is robbed to clothe the back&mdash;the
inner man crucified to make the outside <i>lie</i> you through
the world, or into&mdash;genteel "society." This, though abominable,
is common, and leads to innumerable ups and downs,
crime and fun, in this old world that we temporarily inhabit.</p>

<p>Choosing rather to give our life pictures a familiar and
diverting&mdash;and certainly none the less instructive garb&mdash;than
to hunt up misery, and depict the <ins title="woful">woeful</ins> tragics of our
existence, we will give the facts of a case&mdash;not uncommon,
we ween, either, that came to us from a friend of one of the parties.</p>

<p>In most cities&mdash;especially, perhaps, in Baltimore and
Washington, are any quantity of decayed families; widows
and orphans of men&mdash;who, while blessed with oxygen and
hydrogen sufficient to keep them healthy and active&mdash;held
offices, or such positions in the business world as enabled
them and their families to carry pretty stiff necks, high
heads, and go into what is called "good society;" meaning
of course where good furniture garnishes good finished <ins title="domicils">domiciles</ins>,
good carpets, good rents, good dinners, and where good
clothes are exhibited&mdash;but where good intentions, good
manners and morals are mostly of no great importance. As, in
most all such cases, when, by some fortuitous accident,
the head of the family collapses, or dies,&mdash;the reckless regard
for society having led to the squandering of the income,
fast or faster than it came, the poor family is driven
by the same society, so coveted, to hide away&mdash;move off,
and by a thousand dodges of which wounded pride is capable,
work their way through the world, under tissues of
false pretences; at once ludicrous and pitiable. Such a
family we have in view. Colonel Somebody held a lucrative
office under government, in the city of Washington.
Colonel Somebody, one day, very unexpectedly, died.
There was nothing mysterious in that, but the Somebodies
having always cut quite a swell in the "society" of the capital&mdash;which
society, let us tell you, is of the most fluctuating,
tin-foil and ephemeral character; it was by some considered
strange, that as soon as Colonel Somebody had been
decently buried in his grave, his family at once made a sale
of their most expensive furniture&mdash;the horses, carriage, and
man-servant disappeared, and the Somebodies apprized
society that they were going north, to reside upon an estate
of the Colonel's in New York. And so they vanished.
Whither they went or how they fared society did not know,
and society did not care!</p>

<p>Mrs. Somebody had two daughters and a son, the eldest
twenty-three, <i>confessedly</i>, and the youngest, the son, seventeen.
Marriages, in such society, floating and changing as it
does in Washington, are not frequent, and less happy or prosperous
when effected; every body, inclined to become acquainted,
or form matrimonial connections, are ever on the
alert for something or somebody better than themselves; and
under such circumstances, naturally enough, Miss Alice
Somebody&mdash;though a pretty girl&mdash;talented, as the world goes,
highly educated, too, as many hundreds beside her, was still
a spinster at twenty-three. The fact was, Mrs. Somebody
was a woman of experience in the world&mdash;indeed, a dozen
years' experience in life at Washington, had given her very
definite ideas of expediency and diplomacy; and hence, as
the means were cut off to live in their usual style and
expensiveness&mdash;Mrs. Somebody packed up and retired to
Baltimore. The son soon found an occupation in a store&mdash;the
daughter, being a woman of taste and education, resorted
to&mdash;as a matter of <i>diversion</i>&mdash;they could not think
of earning a living, of course!&mdash;the needle&mdash;while Mrs.
Somebody arranged a pair of neat apartments, for two
"gentlemen of unexceptionable reference," as boarders.</p>

<p>During their palmy days at the capital of the nation,
Miss Alice Somebody came in contact with a young gentleman
named Rhapsody,&mdash;of pleasant and respectable
demeanor, <i>an office-holder</i>, but not high up enough to suit
the tastes and aims of Colonel Somebody and his lady;
and so, our friend Rhapsody stood little or no chance for
favor or preferment in the graces of Miss Alice, though he
was a recognized visitor at the Colonel's house, and essayed
to make an impression upon the heart's affections of the
Colonel's daughter.</p>

<p>Time fled, and with its fleetings came those changes in
the fates and fortunes of the Somebodies, we have noted.
Nor was our friend Rhapsody without his changes,&mdash;mutations
of fortune, a change of government, made changes.
Rhapsody one morning was not as much surprised as mortified
to find his "services no longer required," as a new
hand was awaiting his withdrawal. Rhapsody, true to
custom at the capital&mdash;lived up to and ahead of his salary;
and, when deposed, deemed it prudent to make his exit
from a spot no longer likely to be favorable to the self-respect
or personal comfort of a man bereft of power, and
without patronage or position. Rhapsody, by trade (luckily
he had a trade), was a boot-maker. Start not, reader, at
the idea; we know "shoemaker" may have a tendency to
shock some people, whose moral and mental culture has
been sadly neglected, or quite perverted; but Rhapsody
was but a boot-maker, and no doubt quite as gentlemanly&mdash;physically
and mentally considered, as the many thousands
who merely <i>wear</i> boots, for the luxury of which they are
indebted to the skill, labor and industry of others. Rhapsody
came down gracefully, and quite as manfully, to his
level, only changing the scene of his endeavors to the city
of monuments. Rhapsody had feelings&mdash;pride. He sought
obscurity, in which he might perform the necessary labors
of his craft, to enable him to keep his head above water,
and await that tide in the affairs of men, when perhaps he
might again be drifted to fortune and favor.</p>

<p>Rhapsody took lodgings in a respectable hotel; he arose
late&mdash;took breakfast, read the news&mdash;smoked&mdash;lounged&mdash;dressed,
and went through the ordinary evolutions of a gentleman
of leisure, until he dined at 3 P. M.; then, by a
circuitous way, he proceeded to his shop&mdash;put on his working
attire, and went at it faithfully, until midnight, when,
having accomplished his maximum of toil, he re-dressed&mdash;walked
to his hotel&mdash;talked politics&mdash;fashions, etc., took his
glass of wine with a friend, and very quietly retired; to
rise on the morrow, and go through the same routine from
day to day, only varying it a little by an eye to an eligible
marriage, or a place.</p>

<p>Rhapsody&mdash;we must give him the credit of the fact&mdash;from
no mawkish feeling of his own, but from force of
public opinion, resorted to this secret manner of eking out
his daily bread, and acting out his part of the fictitious
gentleman. During one of his morning lounges&mdash;accidentally,
Rhapsody met Miss Somebody in the street. They
had not met for some few years, and it may not be troublesome
to conceive, that Miss Alice&mdash;under the new order
of things&mdash;was more pleased than otherwise to renew the
acquaintance of other days, with a gentleman still supposed
to be&mdash;and his attire and manner surely gave no sign of an
altered state of affairs&mdash;in a position recognizable by society.</p>

<p>Rhapsody renewed his attentions to the Somebody family,
and Miss Alice in particular&mdash;with fervor. He admitted
himself no longer an <i>attache</i> of government, but
offset the deprivation of government patronage, by asserting
that he was graduating for a higher sphere in life than
the drudgery and abjectness of a clerkship&mdash;he was studying
political economy, and the learned profession of the law!</p>

<p>The Somebodies were <i>game</i>; not a concession would
they make to stern indigence; it was merely for the sake
of quietude, said Mrs. Somebody, and the solace of retirement
from the gay and tempestuous whirls of society, that
<i>we</i> changed the scene and dropped a peg lower in domestic
show. Rhapsody believed Colonel Somebody a man of
substance. He knew how easy it was to account for the
expenditure of fifteen hundred dollars a year, but it did not
so readily appear possible for a man holding the Colonel's
place and perquisites, some thousands a year, to die poor,
without estate; ergo, the Somebodies were still, doubtless,
<i>somebody</i>, and the more the infatuated Rhapsody dwelt
upon it, the more he absorbed the idea of forming an
alliance with the dead Colonel's family. And the favor
with which he was received seemed to facilitate matters as
desirably as could be wished for. What airy castles, or
gossamer projects may have haunted the fancy of our sanguine
friend, Rhapsody, we know not; but that he whacked
away more cheerily at his trade, and kept up his appearances
spiritedly, was evident enough. An expert and
artistic craftsman, he secured paying work, and executed it
to the satisfaction of his employers.</p>

<p>The industry of the Somebodies was one of the traits in
the characters of the two young women, particularly
commendatory to Rhapsody; he seldom paid them a morning
or afternoon call, that they were not diligently engaged
with needles and Berlin wool&mdash;fashioning wrought suspenders
for brother, slippers for brother, or mother, or sister,
or the Rev. Mr. So-and-So&mdash;the recently made inmate of
the family. The multiplicity of such performances, for
brother, mother, sister, the reverend gentleman&mdash;<i>mere pastime</i>,
as Mrs. Somebody would remark,&mdash;most probably
would have caused a mystery or misgiving in the minds of
many adventurous <i>Lotharios</i>; but Rhapsody, though, as
we see, a man of the world, had something yet to learn of
society and its complexities. Things progressed smoothly&mdash;the
reverend gentleman facetiously cajoled Miss Alice
and the mother upon the issue of coming events&mdash;the lively
young lawyer, etc., etc.,&mdash;and it seemed to be a settled matter
that Miss Alice was to be the bride of Mr. Rhapsody
at last.</p>

<p>Rhapsody, usually, after dark, in the evening, in his
laboring garments, made his return of work and received
more. Whilst thus out, one evening, on business, in making
a sudden turn of a corner, he came plump upon Mrs.
Somebody and Alice! Rhapsody would have dashed down
a cellar&mdash;into a shop&mdash;up an alley, or sunk through the
footwalk, had any such opportunity offered, but there was
none&mdash;he was there&mdash;beneath the flame of a street lamp,
with the eagle eyes of all the party upon him! Cut off
from retreat, he boldly faced the enemy!</p>

<p>He was going to a political caucus meeting in a noisy
and turbulent ward&mdash;apprehended a disturbance&mdash;donned
those shady habiliments, and the large green bag in his
hand, that a&mdash;well, though it did not seem to contain such
goods, was supposed, for the nonce, to contain his books
and papers; documents he was likely to have use for at the
caucus! Rhapsody got through&mdash;it was a tight shave; he
dexterously declined accompanying the ladies home&mdash;they
were rather queerly attired themselves, it occurred to Rhapsody;
they made some excuse for their appearance, and so
the maskers <i>quit, even</i>. Time passed on&mdash;Alice and Rhapsody
had almost climaxed the preparatory negotiations of
an hymenial conclusion, when another <i>contretemps</i> came
to pass&mdash;it was the grand finale.</p>

<p>It was on a rather blustery night, that Rhapsody, in
haste, sought the shop of his employer; he had work in
hand which, being ordered done at a certain hour, for an
anxious customer, he was in haste to deliver. His green
bag under his arm, in rushed Rhapsody,&mdash;the servant of
the customer was awaiting the arrival of the <i>bottier</i> and his
master's boots. The shopman eagerly seized Rhapsody's
verdant-colored satchel, and out came the boots, and which
underwent many critical inspections, eliciting sundry professional
remarks from the shopman, to our hero, Rhapsody,
who, in his business matters had assumed, it appeared, the
more humble name of <i>Mr. Jones</i>, in the shop. The customer's
servant stood by the counter&mdash;fencing off a lady,
further on&mdash;from immediate notice of Rhapsody. A side
glance revealed sundry patterns or specimens of most elegantly-wrought
slippers&mdash;the boss of the shop, and the
lady, were apparently negotiating a trade, in these embroidered
articles; the lady, now but a few feet from Rhapsody
and the garrulous shopman, turned toward the poor
fellow just as the shopman had stuffed more work into the
green bag&mdash;their eyes met. Rhapsody felt an all-overish
sensation peculiar to that experienced by an amateur in a
shower bath, during his first <i>douse</i>, or the incipient criminal
detected in his initiatory crime! Poor Rhapsody felt like
fainting, while Miss Alice Somebody, without the nerve to
gather up her work, or withstand a further test of the force
of circumstances, precipitately left the store, her face red
as scarlet, and her demeanor wild and incomprehensible, at
least to all but Rhapsody.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Rhapsody was at breakfast the next morning&mdash;a servant
announced a gentleman in the parlor desirous of an interview
with Mr. Rhapsody&mdash;it was granted, and soon <i>Jones</i>,
the <i>boot-maker</i>, confronted the Rev. Mr. So-and-So. Though
an inclination to <i>smile</i> played about the pleasant features
of the reverend gentleman, he assumed to be severe upon
what he called the duplicity of Mr. Rhapsody; and that
gentleman patiently hearing the story out, quietly asked:</p>

<p>"Are you, sir, here as an accuser&mdash;denouncer, or an
ambassador of peace and good will?"</p>

<p>"The latter, sir, is my self-constituted mission," said the
reverend gentleman.</p>

<p>"Then," said Rhapsody, "I am ready to make all necessary
concessions&mdash;a clean breast of it, you may say. I am
in a false position&mdash;struggling against public opinion&mdash;false
pride&mdash;falsely, and yet honestly, working my way
through the world. I am no more nor less, nominally,
than <i>Jones, the boot-maker</i>. Now," continued Rhapsody,
"if a false purpose covers not a false heart also, I can yet
be happy in the affections of Miss Somebody, and she in
mine. For those who can battle as we have, against the
common chances of indigence, upright and alone in our integrity,
may surely yet win greater rewards by mutual consolation
and support, our fortunes joined."</p>

<p>"I have not been mistaken, then, sir," said the reverend
gentleman, "in your character, if I was in your occupation;
and you may rely upon my friendly service in an amicable
and definite arrangement of this very delicate matter."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When General Harrison took the "chair of state," our
friend Rhapsody was reinstated in his place, occupied years
before, and by fortuitous circumstances he got still higher&mdash;an
appointment of trust connected with a handsome salary;
so that Jones, the boot-maker, was enabled to re-enter the
Somebodies into the gay and fluctuating society at the
national capital, from which they had been so unceremoniously
driven by the death of the husband and father. Mrs.
Somebody, that was, however, is now a much older and
much wiser person, the wife of our ministerial friend, who
vouches the difficulty he had in overcoming Mrs. Somebody's
repugnance to leather&mdash;and for sundry quibbles&mdash;yea,
strong arguments against any blood of hers ever uniting
with the fates and fortunes of a boot-maker; with what
<i>propriety</i>, her experience has long since taught her. Alice
is the happiest of women, mother of many fine children,
the wife of a man poverty could not corrupt, if public
opinion forced him to mask the means that gave him bread.
Rhapsody is no longer a politician, or office-holder, but engaged
in lucrative pursuits that yield comfort and position
in society. To relate the trials, courtship and marriage of
"Jones, the boot-maker," is one of our friend Rhapsody's
standing jokes, to friends at the fireside and dinner table;
but that such a safe and happy tableau would again befall
parties so circumstanced, is a very material question; and
the moral of our story, being rather complex, though very
definite, we leave to society, and you, reader, to determine.</p>

<p>A gentleman from "out 'town," came into Redding &amp;
Co.'s on Christmas day, and leaning thoughtfully over the
counter, says he to Prescott, "Got any Psalms here?"</p>

<p>"N-n-no," says Prescott, reflectingly, "but," he continued,
after a moment's pause, and handing down a copy of
Hood, "here's plenty of old Joe's!"</p>

<p>The out-of-town gentleman gave a glance at <i>the pictures</i>,
and with a countenance indicative of having been tasting a
crab-apple&mdash;left!</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="Pills_and_Persimmons" id="Pills_and_Persimmons"></a>Pills and Persimmons.</h2>


<p>I remember an old "Joke" told me by my father, of
an old, and rather addle-headed gentleman, who some
fifty years ago did business in New Castle, Delaware, and
having occasion to send out to England for hardware, wrote
his order, and as he was about to despatch it to the captain
of the ship, lying in the stream, ready for sea, a neighbor
got him to add an order for some kegs of nails, and in the
hurry, the old man dashed off his <i>P. S.</i>, but upon attempting
to read the whole order over, he couldn't make head or
tail of it.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, in a flurry, "I'll send it, just as it is;
they are better scholars in England than I am&mdash;<i>they'll make
it out</i>."</p>

<p>Strange enough to say, when the hardware came over,
among the rest of the stuff were the so many kegs of nails,
but upon opening one of these kegs, it was full, or nearly so,
of <ins title="Amercian">American</ins> quarter dollars. The old man roared out in a
[word missing].</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! haw! Well, blast me," says he, "if <i>they</i>
ain't scholars, fust-rate scholars, in England; <i>it's worth
while sending 'em bad manuscript</i>."</p>

<p>A still more comical mistake is related to us, of a commercial
transaction that actually took place within a year
or two, between parties severally situated in Boston and
the city of San Francisco, California. As we consider the
whole transaction rather <i>rich</i>, we transcribe it for the
diversion it may furnish.</p>

<p>Simmons, the "Oak Hall" man, of Boston, had set up a
shop in San Francisco, to which he was almost daily sending
all sorts of cheap clothing, and making, on the same,
more money than a horse could pull; and in his package,
he was in the habit of sending articles for friends, &amp;c. A
gentleman recently gone to the gold country, from Boston,
acquainted with Simmons, and Simmons with him, found,
upon looking around San Francisco, that his own business,
<i>lawing</i>, wasn't worth two cents, as many of his craft were
turning their attention to matters more useful to the human
family&mdash;digging cellars, wheeling baggage, driving teams,
&amp;c. So lawyer Bunker <i>turned</i> his attention from Blackstone,
Chitty, Coke on Littleton, and those fellows of deep-red,
blue-black law, to the manufacture of quack nostrums.
Bunker found that the great appetite we Yankees have for
quack medicines, pills and powders, suffered no diminution
in the gold country; on the contrary, the appetite became
rather sharpened for those luxuries, and Bunker found that
a New York butcher, with whom he became acquainted,
was absolutely making his fortune, by the manufacture of
dough pills, spiced with coriander, and a slight tincture of calomel.</p>

<p>"Egad!" says Bunker, "<i>I'll</i> go into medicine. I'll write
to a friend in Boston, to send me <i>out</i> a few medicine and
receipt books, and a lot of pulverized liquorice, quinine,
&amp;c., with a pill machine, and I guess I'll be after my New
York butchering friend in a double brace of shakes."</p>

<p>Now, it may be premised that as Bunker was a lawyer, he
wrote a first-rate hand; in fact, he might have bragged of
being able to equal, if not surpass, the "Hon." Rufus
Choate, whose scrawl more resembles the scratchings of a
poor half-drowned in an ink-saucer spider, meandering over
foolscap, than quill-driving, and as unintelligible as the
marks of a tea-box or hieroglyphics on the sarcophagus of
ye ancient Egyptians! In short, Counsellor Bunker's manuscript
was awful; a few of his most intimate friends, only,
pretending to have the hang of it at all; and to one of these
friends, Bunker directs his message, transmits it by Uncle
Sam's mail <i>poche</i>, and in fever heat he awaits the return
of the precious combustibles that were to make his fortune.
In course of time, Bunker's friends receive the order, but,
alas! it was all Greek to them; they cyphered in vain, to
make out any thing in the letters except <i>persimmons</i>.</p>

<p>"What the deuce," says one of Bunker's friends, "does
Joe want with persimmons?"</p>

<p>They went at it again, and again, but there was no mistaking
the final sentence, "<i>send, without delay, persimmons</i>."</p>

<p>"Persimmons?" said one.</p>

<p>"Persimmons?" echoed another.</p>

<p>"Persimmons? What in thunder does Joe Bunker want
with <i>persimmons</i>?" responded a third.</p>

<p>"Persimmons!" all three chimed.</p>

<p>"Persimmons," says one, "are not used in law proceedings, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Nor in gospel, even, provided Joe has got into that,"
responded another.</p>

<p>"Persimmons are not medicinal."</p>

<p>"They are not chemical."</p>

<p>"Persimmons are no part, or ingredient, in art, science,
law, or religion; now, for what does Joe Bunker, counsellor
at law, want us to forward, without delay, <i>persimmons</i>?"</p>

<p>Well, they couldn't tell; in vain they reasoned. Joe's
letter was very brief, strictly to the point, and that point
was&mdash;<i>persimmons!</i> In the first place, it is not everybody
that knows exactly what persimmons are, where they come
from, and what they are good for. One of Bunker's friends
had lived in the South; he knew persimmons; it occurred
to him that possums, and some human beings, especially the
colored pop'lation, were the only critters particularly fond of
the fruit. Webster was consulted, to see what light he cast
upon the matter: he informed them that "<i>Persimmon</i> was
a tree, and its fruit, a species of <i>Diospyros</i>, a native of the
States south of New York. Fruit like a plum, and when
not ripe, very hard and astringent (rather so), but when ripe,
luscious and highly nutritious."</p>

<p>"Well, there," said one of Bunker's friends, "I'll bet
Joe's sick; persimmons have been prescribed for his cure,
and the sooner we send the persimmons the better!"</p>

<p>"Persimmons! Now I come to think of it," says the
man who had a faint idea of what persimmons were, "they
make beer, first-rate beer of persimmons, in the South, and
it's my opinion, that Joe Bunker is going into persimmon
beer business; as you say, he <i>may be</i> sick&mdash;persimmon beer
may be the California cure-all; in either case, let us forward
the persimmons without delay!"</p>

<p>Now persimmons never ripen until <i>touched</i> pretty smartly
with Jack Frost. This was in September; persimmons
were mostly full grown, but not ripe. A large keg of them
was ordered from Jersey, and as fast as Adams &amp; Co.'s
great Express to San Francisco could take them out, <i>the
persimmons went!</i></p>

<p>Counsellor Bunker, relying upon his friends to forward
without delay the tools and remedial agents to make his
fortune in the pill business, went to work, got him an office,
changed his name, and added an M. D. to it, had a sign
painted, advertised his shop, and informed the public that
on such a time he would open, and guarantee to cure all
ills, from <ins title="lubago">lumbago</ins> to liver complaint, from toothache to lock-jaw,
spring fever to yaller janders, and in his enthusiasm,
he sat down with a ream of paper, to count up the profits,
and calculate the time it would take to get his pile of gold
dust and start for home.</p>

<p>The day arrived that Doctor Phlebotonizem was to open,
and he found customers began to <i>call</i>, and sure enough, in
comes a large keg, direct through from the States, to his
address; the freight bill on it was pretty considerable, but
Joe out and paid it, rejoicing to think that now he was all
right, and that if the proprietors of gold dust and the lumbago,
or any of the various ills set forth in his catalogue of
human woes, had spare change, he would soon find them out.
He closed his door, opened his cask&mdash;</p>

<p>"What in the name of everlasting sin and misery is this?"
was the first <i>burst</i>, upon feeling the fine saw dust, and
seeing, nicely packed, the green and purple, round and
glossy&mdash;he couldn't tell what.</p>

<p>"Pills? No, good gracious, they can't be <i>pills</i>&mdash;smell
queer&mdash;some mistake&mdash;can't be any mistake&mdash;my name on
the cask&mdash;(tastes one of the 'article')&mdash;O! by thunder!
(tastes again)&mdash;I'm blasted, they (tastes again) are, by Jove,
<i>persimmons!</i> Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! he! he!
ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>And the ex-counsellor of modern law roared until he grew
livid in the face.</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;ha! ha! I see; they have misunderstood every
line I wrote them, except the last, and that&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;for
my direction to send out my stuff <i>per Simmons</i>, they
send me <span class="smcap">persimmons</span>! Ha! ha! ha! ho! ho!"</p>

<p>But, after enjoying the <i>fun</i> of the matter, ex-counsellor
Bunker discovered the thing was nothing to laugh at;
<i>patients</i> were at the door&mdash;if he did not soon prescribe for
their cases, his now numerous creditors would prescribe for
him! What was to be done? Very dull and prosy people
often become enterprising and imaginative, to a wonderful
degree, when put to their trumps. This philosophical fact
applied to ex-counsellor Bunker's case exactly. He was
there to better his fortune, and he felt bound to do it, persimmons
or no persimmons. It occurred to him, as those
infernal persimmons had cost him something, they ought
to <i>bring in</i> something. By the aid of starch and sugar,
Doctor Phlebotonizem converted some hundreds of the
smallest persimmons into <i>pills</i>&mdash;sugar-coated pills&mdash;warranted
to cure about all the ills flesh was heir to, at
$2 each dose. One generally constituted a dose for a full-grown
person, and as the patient left with a countenance
much "puckered up," and rarely returned, the <i><ins title="psuedo">pseudo</ins></i>
M. D. concluded there was virtue in persimmon pills, and so,
after disposing of his stock to first-rate advantage, the
doctor paid off his bills; tired of the pill trade, he <i>vamosed
the ranche</i> with about funds enough to reach home, and
explain to his friends the difference between <i>per</i> Simmons
and <i>persimmons!</i></p>

of it coming under the "Editorial" head is about as comfortable
as the bed of Procustes would be to an invalid. It
may doubtless look and sound well, to see one's name in

<p>"A gentleman by the name of Collins stopping with you?"</p>

<p>"Collins?" was the response.</p>

<p>"Yes, Collins, or Collings, I ain't sure which," said the
hardy-looking, bronzed seaman, to the gaily-dressed,
flippant-mannered, be-whiskered man of vast importance, presiding
over the affairs of one of our "first-class hotels."</p>

<p>"Very indefinite inquiry, then," said the hotel manager.</p>

<p>"Well, I brought this small package from Bremen for a
gentleman who came out passenger with us some time ago;
he left it in Bremen&mdash;wanted me to fetch it out when the
ship returned&mdash;here it is."</p>

<p>"What do you want to leave it here for? We know
nothing about the man, sir."</p>

<p>"You don't? Well, you ought to, for the gentleman put
up here, and told me he'd be around when we got into port
again. He was a deuced clever fellow, and you ought to
have kept the reckoning of such a man," said the seaman.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! we keep so many clever fellows," said he of
the hotel, "that they are no novelties, sir."</p>

<p>"I wonder then," said the seaman, "you do not imitate
some of them, for there's no danger of the world's getting
crowded with a crew of good men."</p>

<p>"If you have any business with us we shall attend to it,
sir, but we want none of your impertinence!"</p>

<p>"O, you don't? Well, Mister, I've business aboard of
your craft; if you're the commodore, I'd like you to see that
my friend Collins is piped up, or that this package be stowed
away where he could come afoul of it. His name is Collins;
here it is in black and white, on the parcel, and here's
where I was to drop it."</p>

<p>One of the "understrappers" overhearing the dispute,
whispered his dignified superior that Mr. Collins, an English
gentleman, late from Bremen, was in the house, whereupon
the dignified empressario, turning to the self-possessed man
of the sea, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, well, leave the parcel, leave the parcel; we <i>suppose</i>
it's correct."</p>

<p>"There it is," said the seaman; "commodore, you see
that the gentleman gets it; and I say," says the sailor,
pushing back his hat and giving his breeches a regular
sailor twitch, "I wish you'd please to say to the gentleman,
Mr. Collins, you know, that Mr. Brace, first officer of the
Triton, would like to see him aboard, any time he's at leisure."</p>

<p>But in the multiplicity of greater affairs, the hotel gentleman
hardly attempted to listen or attend to the sailor's
message, and Mr. Brace, first officer of the Triton, bore
away, muttering to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"These land-crabs mighty apt to put on airs. I'd like
to have that powder monkey in my watch about a week&mdash;I'd
have him down by the lifts and braces!"</p>

<p>Let us suppose it to be in the glorious month of October,
when the myriads of travellers by land and ocean are wending
their way from the chilly north towards the sunny south,
when the invalid seeks the tropics in pursuit of his health,
and the speculative man of business returns with his "invoices,"
to his shop, or factory, where profit leads the way.</p>

<p>We are on board ship&mdash;the Triton ploughing the deep
blue waters of the ocean track from Sandy Hook to New
Orleans; for October, the weather is rather unruly, <i>damp</i>,
and boisterous. We perceive a number of passengers
on board, and by near guess of our memory, we see a person
or two we have seen before. Our be-whiskered friend of the
"first-class hotel," is there; he does not look so self-possessed
and pompous on board the heaving and tossing ship
as he did behind his marble slab in "the office." "The
sea, the sea!" as the song says, has quite taken the starch
out of our stiff friend, who is not enjoying a first-rate time.
And from an overheard conversation between two hardy,
noble specimens of men that are men&mdash;two officers of the
stoutly-timbered ship, the comfort of the be-whiskered gentleman
is in danger of a commutation.</p>

<p>"Do you know him, Mr. Brace?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him; I knew him as soon as I got the cut
of his jib coming aboard. Now, says I, my larky, you and
I've got to travel together, and we'll settle a little odd
reckoning, if you please, or if you don't please, afore we see
the Balize. You see, that fellow keeps a crack hotel in
York; I goes in there to deliver a package for a deuced
good fellow as ever trod deck, and this powder monkey,
loblolly-looking swab, puts on his airs, sticks up his nose,
and hardly condescends to exchange signals with me. Ha!
ha! I've met these galore cocks before; I can take the tail
feathers out of 'em!" says Mr. Brace, who is the same
hardy, frank and free fellow, with whom the reader has already
formed something of a brief acquaintance. The person
to whom Brace was addressing himself was the second
officer of the merchantman, and it was settled that whatever
nautical knowledge and skill could do to make things
uneasy for Mr. Lollypops, the empressario of the "first-class
hotel," was to be done, by mutual management of the
two salt-water jokers.</p>

<p>"It appears to me, that a&mdash;bless me, sir, a&mdash;how this
ship rolls!" said Lollypops, coming upon deck, and addressing
Mr. Brace; "I&mdash;a never saw a ship roll so."</p>

<p>"Heavy sea on, sir," said Brace; "nothing to what
we'll catch before a week's out."</p>

<p>"Bad coast, I believe, at this time o' year?" said Lollypops,
balancing himself on first one leg and then the other.</p>

<p>"Worst coast in the world, sir; I'd rather go to Calcutta
any time than go to Orleans; more vessels lost on the coast
than are lost anywhere else on the four seas."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" said Lollypops.</p>

<p>"Fact, sir," said Brace, who occasionally kept exchanging
private and mysterious signals with the second officer,
who held the wheel.</p>

<p>"Let her up a point, Mr. Brown, let her up!" Mr.
Brown did let her up, and the way the Triton took head
down and heels up and a roll to windward, did not speak
so well for the nautical <i>menage</i> of the officers as it did for
the quiet deviltry of the salt-water Joe Millers. The
avalanche of brine inundated the decks, making the sailors
look quite asquirt, and driving Mr. Lollypops, an ancient
voyager or two, and sundry other travelling gentry&mdash;very
suddenly into the cabin. The next day the same performance
followed; the appearance of Lollypops on deck was a
signal for Brace or Brown, to go in, get up a double <i>roll</i>
on the ship, an imaginary gale was discussed, wrecks and
reefs, dangerous points and dreadful currents were descanted
upon, until Mr. Lollypops' health, at the end of the first
week, was no better fast; in fact, he was getting sick of the
voyage, while others around grew fat upon it. A fine
morning induced the invalid to light his regalia and walk
the decks; immediately Mr. Brace, or Brown, gave orders
to wash down the decks. Mr. Lollypops went aloft, <i>ergo</i>,
as far as the main top; immediately the first officer had the
men "going about," heaving here and letting go there; in
short, so endangering the hat and underpinning of the
be-whiskered landlord of the "first-class hotel" that he was
fain to crawl down, take the wet decks, tip-toe, and crawl
into the cabin, damp as a dishcloth, and utterly disgusted
with what he had seen of the sea! Accidentally, one
afternoon, a tar pot fell from aloft; somehow or other, the
careless sailor who held it, or should have held it&mdash;"let go
all" just when Mr. Lollypops was in the immediate neighborhood;
the result was that he had a splendid dressing-gown
and other equipments&mdash;ruined eternally! Going into
the cabin, Lollypops inquires for the Captain&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir!" says he, "I am mad, Sir, very mad, Sir; yes, I am,
Sir; look at me, only look at me! In rough weather we do
not expect pleasant times at sea, but, Sir, ever since I have
been on board, Sir, your infernal officers, Sir, have thrown
this ship into all manner of unpleasant situations, kept the
decks wet, rattled chains over my berth, wang-banged the
rigging around, and finally, by thunder, I'm covered all
over with villanous soap fat and tar! Now, Sir, this is not
all the result of accident&mdash;it's premeditated rascality!"</p>

<p>"Sir"&mdash;says the bully mate, coming forward, at this crisis,
"my name's Mr. Brace; when I was aboard your craft, in
New York, you rather put on <i>airs</i>, and I said if you and I
ever got to sea together&mdash;we'd have a <i>blow</i> out. Now we're
about even; if you're a mind we'll call the matter square&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, for heaven's sake, let us have no more of this!"
says Lollypops.</p>

<p>"We'll have a bottle together, and wish for a clean run
to Orleans!" continued officer Brace.</p>

<p>Lollypops agreed; he not only stood the wine, but got
over his anger, vowed to look deeper into character, and
never again rebuff honest manliness, though hid under the
coarse costume of a son of Neptune! A hearty laugh
closed the scene, and fair weather and a fine termination
attended the voyage of the Triton to New Orleans; for
a finer, drier craft never danced over the ocean wave, than
that good ship, under <i>rational</i> management.</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="The_Broomstick_Marriage" id="The_Broomstick_Marriage"></a>The Broomstick Marriage.</h2>


<p>"Marry in haste and repent at leisure," is a time-honored
idea, and calls to mind a matrimonial circumstance
which, according to pretty lively authority, once
came about in the glorious Empire State. A certain Captain
of a Lake Erie steamer, who was blessed with an elegant
temperament for fun, fashion, and the feminines, was
"laid up," over winter, near his childhood's home in Genesee
county. Having nearly exhausted his private stock of
jokes, and gone the entire rounds of life and liveliness of
the season, he bethought him how he should create a little
<i>stir</i>, and have his joke at the expense of a young Doctor,
who had recently "located" in the neighborhood, and by
his rather <i>taking</i> person and manners, cut <ins title="somethiug">something</ins> of a
swath in the community, and especially amongst the <i>calico!</i></p>

<p>The profession of young Esculapius gave him an access
to private society that ordinary circumstances did not vouch
to most men. Among the many families with which Dr.
Mutandis had formed an acquaintance was that of old Capt.
Figgles. The Captain was a queer old mortal, who in his
hale old days had quit life on the ocean wave for the quietude
of agricultural comfort. The Captain was a blustering
salt, whimsical, but generous and social, as old sailors most
generally are. He was supposed to be in easy circumstances,
but <i>how</i> easy, very few knew.</p>

<p>Capt. Figgles's family consisted of himself, three daughters,
one married and "settled," the other two at home; an
ancient colored woman, who had served in the Captain's
family,&mdash;ship and shore&mdash;a lifetime. Dinah and old Sam,
her husband, with two or three farm-laborers, constituted
the Captain's household. Betsy, the youngest daughter,
the old man's favorite, had been christened Elizabeth, but
that not being warm enough for Capt. Figgles's idea of
attachment, he ever called his daughter, Betsy, and so she
was called by <i>almost</i> everybody at all familiar with the
family. Betsy Figgles was not a very poetical subject, by
name or size. She was a fine, bouncing young woman of
four-and-twenty; she was dutiful and bountiful, if not beautiful.
She was useful, and even ornamental in her old
father's eyes, and, as he was wont to say, in his never-to-be-forgotten
salt-water <i>linguæ</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Betsy was a <i>craft</i>, she was; a square-bilt, trim, well-ballasted
craft, fore and aft; none of your sky-scraping, taut,
Baltimore clipper, fair-weather, no-tonnage jigamarees!
Betsy is a <i>woman</i>; her mother was just like her when I fell
in with her, and it wasn't long afore I chartered her for a
life's voyage. And the man who lets such a woman slip her
cable and stand off soundings, for 'Cowes and a market,'
when he's got a chance to fill out her papers and take command,
is not a <i>man</i>, but a mouse, or a long-tailed Jamaica rat!"</p>

<p>Between Capt. Tiller, our Lake boatman, and Capt.
Figgles, there was an intimacy of some years' standing, but
the old Captain and the young Captain didn't exactly "hitch
horses"&mdash;whether it was because Capt. T. came under the
old man's idea of "a Jamaica rat," or because he looked
upon inland sailors as greenhorns, deponent saith not.</p>

<p>Dr. Mutandis and Capt. Figgles were only upon so-so
sort of business sociality, though both the junior Captain
and the Doctor were intimate enough with both the Miss
Figgleses. Capt. Tiller, as we intimated, was about to
leave for coming duties on the Lake, and being so full of
old Nick, it was indispensable that he must play off a practical
joke, or have some fun with somebody, as a sort of a
yarn for the season, on his boat.</p>

<p>The Figgleses announced a grand quilting scrape; the
Doctor and Captain were among the invited guests, of
course, and for some hours the assembled party had indeed
as grand a good time generally as usually falls to the lot of
a country community. Old black Ebenezer&mdash;but whose
name had also been cut down for convenience sake to <i>Sam</i>,
by the old Captain&mdash;did the orchestral duties upon his fiddle,
which, aided by a youngster on the triangle and another on
the tambourine, formed quite "a full band" for the occasion,
and dancing was done up in style!</p>

<p>As a sort of "change of scene" or divertisement in the
programme, somebody proposed games of this and games of
that, and while old Capt. Figgles was as busy as "a flea in
a tar bucket"&mdash;to use the old gentleman's simile&mdash;fulminating
and fabricating a rousing bowl of egg flip for the entire
party, Capt. Tiller and Dr. Mutandis were sort of paired
off with a party of eight, in which were the two Miss
Figgleses, to get up their own game.</p>

<p>"Good!" says Capt. Tiller, "pair off with Miss Betsy,
Doctor, and I'll pair off with Miss Sally (the older daughter
of Capt. F.), and now what say you? Let's make up a
wedding-party&mdash;<i>let's jump the broomstick!</i>"</p>

<p>"Agreed!" cries the Doctor. "Who'll be the parson?"</p>

<p>"I'll be parson," says Capt. T.</p>

<p>"Well, get your book."</p>

<p>"Here it is!" cries another, poking a specimen of
current Scripture into the <i>pseudo</i> parson's hands.</p>

<p>"Miss Betsy and Dr. Mutandis, stand up," says Capt.
Tiller, assuming quite the air and grace of the parson.</p>

<p>Bridesmaids, grooms, &amp;c., were soon arranged in due
order, and the interesting ceremony of joining hands and
hearts in one happy bond of mutual and indissoluble
(slightly, sometimes!) love and obedience was progressing.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Figgles, you're wanted," says one, interrupting
the old man, now busy concocting his grog for all hands.</p>

<p>"Go to blazes, you son of a sea cook!" cries the old
gentleman; "haven't you common decency to see when a
man's engaged in a <i>calculation</i> he oughtn't to be disturbed, eh?"</p>

<p>"But Betsy's going to be married!" insists the disturber,
who, in fact, was half-seas over in infatuation with Miss
Betsy, and had had a slight inkling of a fact that by the
law of the State anybody could marry a couple, and the
marriage would be as obligatory upon the parties as though
performed by the identical legal authorities to whom young
folks "in a bad way" are in the habit of appealing for relief.</p>

<p>"Let 'em heave ahead, you marine!" cries Capt. Figgles.</p>

<p>"Are you really willing to allow it?" continues the swain.</p>

<p>"Me willing? It's Betsy's affair; let her keep the lookout,"
said the old gent.</p>

<p>"But don't you know, Cap'n&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! nor I don't care, you swab!" cries the excited
Captain. "Bear away out of here," he continued, beginning
to get down the glasses from the corner-cupboard
shelves, "unless&mdash;but stop! hold on! here, take this waiter,
Jones, and bear a hand with the grog, unless you want to
stand by, and see the ship's company go down by the lifts
and braces, dry as powder-monkeys! There; now pipe all
hands&mdash;ship aho-o-o-oy!" bawls the old Captain; "bear up,
the whole fleet! Now splice the main-brace! Don't nobody
stand back, like loblolly boys at a funeral&mdash;come up
and try Capt. Figgles's grog!"</p>

<p>And up they came, the entire crew, old Ebenezer to the
<i>le'ard</i>, sweating like an ox, and laying off for the piping
bowl he knew he was "in for" from the hands of his indulgent
old master.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the marriage ceremony had had its hour,
and the bride and bridegroom were "skylarking" with the
rest of the company as happily together as turtle-doves in a
clover-patch. The evening's entertainment wound up with
an old-fashioned dance, and the quilting ended. Dr. Mutandis
lived some five miles distant, and having a call to
make the next morning near Capt. Figgles's farm, Dr. M.
concluded to stop with the Captain. As Capt. Tiller was
leaving, he took occasion to whisper into the ear of his
medical friend&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish you much joy, my fine fellow; you're married, if
you did but know it&mdash;fast as a church! Good time to you
and Betsy!"</p>

<p>"The devil!" says the Doctor, musingly; "it strikes me,
since I come to think it over, that the laws of this State do
privilege anybody to marry a couple! By thunder! it
would be a fine spot of work for me if I was held to the
ceremony by Miss Figgles!"</p>

<p>But the Doctor kept quiet, and next morning, after breakfast,
he departed upon his business. He had no sooner
entered the house of his patient, than he was wished much
joy and congratulated upon the <i>fatness</i> and jolly good
nature of his bride!</p>

<p>"But," says the Doctor, "you're mistaken in this affair.
It's all a hoax&mdash;a mere bit of fun!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed his patient, "fun?&mdash;you call getting
married <i>fun</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Doctor; "we were down at Capt. Figgles's;
there was a quilting and sort of a frolic going on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, we heard of it."</p>

<p>"And, in fun, to keep up the sports of the evening, Capt.
Tiller proposed to marry some of us. So Miss Figgles and
I stood up, and Captain Tiller acted parson, and we had
some sport."</p>

<p>"Well," says the farmer (proprietor of the house),
"Capt. Tiller has got you into a tight place, Doctor; he's
been around, laughing at the trick he's played you, as perhaps
you were not aware of the fact that by the law you are
now just as legally and surely married as though the knot
was tied by five dozen parsons or magistrates!"</p>

<p>"I'll shoot Capt. Tiller, by Heavens!" cries the enraged
Doctor. "He's a scoundrel! I'll crop his ears but I'll have satisfaction!"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" says the farmer, "if Betsy Figgles does not object,
and her father is willing and satisfied with the match
as it is, I don't see, Doctor, that you need mind the matter."</p>

<p>"I'll be revenged!" cries the Doctor.</p>

<p>"You were never previously married, were you?" says
the farmer.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Engaged to any lady?" continued the interrogator.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I am too poor, too busy to think of such a folly
as increasing my responsibilities to society!"</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said the farmer, "allow me to congratulate
you upon this very fortunate event, rather than a disagreeable
joke, for Capt. Figgles is worth nearly a quarter of a
million of dollars, sir; and Miss Betsy is no gaudy butterfly,
but, sir, she's an excellent girl, whom you may be proud of
as your wife."</p>

<p>"'Squire," says the Doctor, "jump in with me, and go
back to the Captain's and assist me to back out, beg the
pardon of Miss Figgles and her father, and terminate this
unpleasant farce."</p>

<p>The magistrate-farmer got into the Doctor's gig, and soon
they were at Capt. Figgles's door.</p>

<p>"Captain," says the Doctor, "I don't know what excuse
I <i>can</i> offer for the fool I've made of myself, through
that puppy, Capt. Tiller, but, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look a-here!" says the Captain, staring the Doctor
broad in the face, "I've got wind of the whole affair; now
ease off your palaver. You've married my daughter Betsy,
in a joke; she's fit for the wife of a Commodore, and all
I've got to say is, if you want her, take her; if you don't
want her, you're a fool, and ought to be made a powder-monkey
for the rest of your natural life."</p>

<p>"But the lady's will and wishes have not been consulted, sir."</p>

<p>"Betsy!" cries the old Captain, "come here. What say
you&mdash;are you willing to remain spliced with the Doctor, or
not? Hold up your head, my gal&mdash;speak out!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;<i>I'm agreed, if he is</i>," said she.</p>

<p>"Well said, hurrah!" cries the Captain. "Now, sir (to
the Doctor), to make all right and tight, I here give you,
in presence of the 'Squire, my favorite daughter Betsy,
and one of the best farms in the State of New York. Are
you satisfied, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Captain, I am. I shall try, sir, to make your daughter
a happy woman!" returned the Doctor, and he did; he
became the founder of a large family, and one of the
wealthiest men in the State.</p>

<p>Rather pleased, finally, with the <i>joke</i>, the Doctor managed
to turn it upon the Captain, who in due course of law was
arrested upon the charge of illegally personating a parson,
and marrying a couple without a license! He was fined
fifty dollars and costs; and of course was thus caused to
laugh on the wrong side of his mouth.</p>

<h2><a name="Appearances_are_Deceitful" id="Appearances_are_Deceitful"></a>Appearances are Deceitful.</h2>


<p>There are a great many good jokes told of the false
notions formed as to the character and standing of
persons, as judged by their dress and other outward signs.
It is asserted, that a fine coat and silvery tone of voice,
are no evidence of the gentleman, and few people of the
present day will have the hardihood to assert that a blunt
address, or shabby coat, are infallible recommendations for
putting, however honest, or worthy, a man in a prominent
attitude before the world, or the community he moves in.
Some men of wealth, for the sake of variety, sometimes assume
an eccentric or coarseness of costume, that answers
all very well, as long as they keep where they are known;
but to find out the levelling principles of utter nothingness
among your fellow mortals, only assume a shabby apparel
and stroll out among strangers, and you'll be essentially
<i>knocked</i> by the force of these facts. However, in this or
almost any other Christian community, there is little, if any
excuse, for a man, woman, or child going about or being
"shabby." Let your garments, however coarse, be made
clean and whole, and keep them so; if you have but one
shirt and that minus sleeves and body, have the fragments
washed, and make not your face and hands a stranger to the
refreshing and purifying effects of water.</p>

<p>General Pinckney was one of the old school gentlemen of
South Carolina. A man he was of the most punctilious precision
in manners and customs, in courtesy, and cleanliness
of dress and person; a man of brilliant talents, and, in
every sense of the word, "a perfect gentleman!" Mr.
Pinckney was one of the members of the first Congress, and
during his sojourn in Philadelphia, boarded with an old
lady by the name of Hall, I think&mdash;Mrs. Hall, a staid, prim
and precise dame of the old regime. Mistress Hall was a
widow; she kept but few boarders in her fine old mansion,
on Chestnut street, and her few boarders were mostly members
of Congress, or belonged to the Continental army.
Never, since the days of that remarkable lady we read of in
the books, who made her servant take her chair out of doors,
and air it, if any body by chance sat down on it, and who
was known to empty her tea-kettle, because somebody crossed
the hearth during the operation of boiling water for tea,&mdash;exceeded
Mistress Hall in domestic prudery and etiquette;
hence it may be well imagined that "shabby people" and the
"small fry" generally, found little or no favor in the eyes of
the Quaker landlady of "ye olden time."</p>

<p>General Pinckney having served out his term or resigned
his place, it was filled by another noted individual of Charleston,
General Lowndes, one of the most courteous and talented
men of his day, but the slovenliest and most shockingly
ill-accoutred man on record. But for the care and
watchfulness of one of the most superb women in existence
at the time&mdash;Mrs. Lowndes,&mdash;the General would probably
have frequently appeared in public, with his coat inside out,
and his shirt over all!</p>

<p>General Lowndes, in starting for Philadelphia, was recommended
by his friend Pinckney, to put up at Mistress Hall's;
General P. giving General Lowndes a letter of introduction
to that lady. Travelling was a slow and tedious, as well as
fatiguing and dirty operation, at that day, so that after a
journey from Charleston to Philadelphia, even a man with
some pretensions to dress and respectable <i>contour</i>, would
be apt to look a little "mussy;" but for the poor General's
part, he looked hard enough, in all conscience, and had he
known the <i>effect</i> such an appearance was likely to produce
upon Mistress Hall, he would not have had the
temerity of invading her premises. But the General's views
were far above "buttons," leather, and prunella. Such a
thing as paying deferential courtesies to a man's garments,
was something not dreamed of in his philosophy.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hall's, I believe?" said the General, to a servant
answering the ponderous, lion-headed knocker.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," responded the sable waiter. "Walk dis
way, sah, into de parlor, sah."</p>

<p>The General stalked in, leisurely; around the fire-place
were seated a dozen of the boarders, the aforesaid "big
bugs" of the olden time. Not one moved to offer the stranger
a seat by the fire, although his warm Southern blood
was pretty well congealed by the frosty air of the evening.
The General pulled off his gloves, laid down his great heavy
and dusty valice, and quietly took a remote seat to await
the presence of the landlady. She came, lofty and imposing;
coming into the parlor, with her astute cap upon her
majestic head, her gold spectacles upon her nose, as stately
as a stage queen!</p>

<p>"Good evening," said the gallant General, rising and
making a very polite bow. "Mrs. Hall, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she responded, stiffly, and eyeing Lowndes
with considerable diffidence. "Any business with me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," responded the General, "I&mdash;a&mdash;purpose
remaining in the city some time, and&mdash;a&mdash;I shall be pleased
to put up with you."</p>

<p>"That's impossible, sir," was the ready and decisive reply.
"My house is full; I cannot accommodate you."</p>

<p>"Well, really, that <i>will</i> be a disappointment, indeed,"
said the General, "for I'm quite a stranger in the city, and
may find it difficult to procure permanent lodgings."</p>

<p>"I presume not, sir," said she; "there are <i>taverns</i> enough,
where strangers are entertained."</p>

<p>The gentlemen around the fire, never offered to tender
the stranger any information upon the subject, but several
eyed him very hard, and doubtless felt pleased to see the
discomfitted and ill-accoutred traveller seize his baggage,
adjust his dusty coat, and start out, which <i>he</i> was evidently
very loth to do.</p>

<p>Just as Lowndes had reached the parlor door, it occurred
to him that Pinckney had recommended him to "put up" at
the widow's, and also had given him a letter of introduction
to Mrs. Hall. This reminiscence caused the General to retrace
his steps back into the parlor, where, placing his
portmanteau on the table, he applied the key and opened
it, and began fumbling around for his letters, to the no
small wonder of the landlady and her respectable boarders.</p>

<p>"I have here, I believe, madam, a letter for you," blandly
said the General, still overhauling his baggage.</p>

<p>"A letter for <i>me</i>, sir?" responded the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, from an old friend of yours, who recommended
me to stop with you. Ah, here it is, from your
friend General Pinckney, of South Carolina."</p>

<p>"General Pinckney!" echoed the landlady, all the gentlemen
present cocking their eyes and ears! The widow tore
open the letter, while Lowndes calmly fastened up his portmanteau,
and all of a sudden, quite an incarnation spread its
roseate hues over her still elegant features.</p>

<p>Lowndes seized his baggage, and, with a "good evening,
madam, good evening, gentlemen," was about to leave the
institution, when the lady arrested him with:</p>

<p>"Stop, if you please, sir; this is General Lowndes, I believe?"</p>

<p>"General Lowndes, madam, at your service," said he, with
a dignified bow.</p>

<p>According to all accounts, just then, there was a very
sudden rising about the fire-place, and a twinkling of chairs,
as if they had all just been <i>struck</i> with the idea that there
was a stranger about!</p>

<p>"Keep your seats, gentlemen," said the General; "I
don't wish to disturb any of you, as I'm about to leave."</p>

<p>"General Lowndes," said the widow, "any friend of Mr.
Pinckney is welcome to my house. Though we are full, I
can make room for <i>you</i>, sir."</p>

<p>The General stopped, and the widow and he became first-rate
friends, when they became better acquainted.</p>

<h2><a name="Cigar_Smoke" id="Cigar_Smoke"></a>Cigar Smoke</h2>


<p>Few persons can readily conceive of the amount of cigars
consumed in this country, daily, to say little or nothing of
the yearly smokers. The growing passion for the noxious
weed is truly any thing but pleasantly contemplative. A
boy commences smoking at ten or a dozen years old, and
by the time he should be "of age," he is, in various hot-house
developed faculties, quite advanced in years! And
street smoking, too, has increased, at a rate, within a year
past, that bids fair to make the Puritan breezes of our
evenings as redolent of "smoke and smell," as meets one's
nasal organic faculties upon paying a pop visit to New
York. There is but one idea of useful import that we can
advance in favor of smoking, to any great extent, in our
city: consumption and asthmatic disorders generally are
more prevalent here than in other and more southern climates,
and for the protection of the lungs, cigar smoking, to a
moderate extent, may be useful, as well as pleasurable;
but an indiscriminate "looseness" in smoking is not only a
dead waste of much ready money, but injurious to the eyes,
teeth, breath, taste, smell, and all other senses.</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="Everlasting_Tall_Duel" id="Everlasting_Tall_Duel"></a>An Everlasting Tall Duel</h2>


<p>After all the vicissitudes, ups and downs of a soldier's
life, especially in such a campaign as that in Mexico,
there is a great deal of music mixed up with the misery,
fun with the fuss and feathers, and incident enough to last
a man the balance of a long lifetime.</p>

<p>While camped at Camargo, the officers and privates of
the Ohio volunteer regiment were paid off one day, and, of
course, all who could get <i>leave</i>, started to town, to have a
time, and get clear of their hard earnings.</p>

<p>The Mexicans were some pleased, and greatly illuminated
by the Americans, that and the succeeding day.
Several of the officers invested a portion of their funds in
mules and mustangs. Among the rest, Lieut. Dick Mason
and Adjt. Wash. Armstrong set up their private teams.
Now, it so fell out, that one of Armstrong's men stole
Mason's mule, and being caught during the day with the
stolen property on him, or he on it, the high-handed private,
(who, barring his propensity to ride in preference to
walking, was a very clever sort of fellow, and rather popular
with the Adjutant,) nabbed him as a hawk would a pip-chicken.</p>

<p>"If I catch the fellow who stole my mule," quoth Lieut.
Dick, "I'll give him a lamming he won't forget soon!"</p>

<p>And, good as his word, when the man was taken, the
Lieutenant had him whipped severely. This riled up Adjt.
Wash., who, in good, round, unvarnished terms, volunteered
to lick the Lieutenant&mdash;out of his leathers! From words
they came to blows, very expeditiously, and somehow or
other the Lieutenant came out second best&mdash;bad licked!
This sort of a finale did not set well upon the stomach of
the gallant Lieutenant; so he ups and writes a challenge to
the Adjutant to meet in mortal combat; and readily finding
a second, the challenge was signed, sealed, and delivered to
Adjt. Armstrong, Company &mdash;&mdash;, Ohio volunteers. All
these preliminaries were carried on in, or very near in,
Camargo. The Adjutant readily accepted the invitation to
step out and be shot at; and, having scared up his second,
and having no heirs or assigns, goods, chattels, or other
sublunary matters to adjust, no time was lost in making
wills or leaving posthumous information. The duel went
forward with alacrity, but all of a sudden it was discovered
by the several interested parties that no arms were in the
crowd. It would not very well do to go to camp and look
for duelling weapons; so it was proposed to do the best that
could be done under the circumstances, and buy such murderous
tools as could be found at hand, and go into the
merits of the case at once. At length the Adjutant and
friend chanced upon a machine supposed to be a pistol,
brought over to the Continent, most probably, by Cortez, in
the year 1&mdash;sometime. It was a <i>scrougin</i>' thing to hold
powder and lead, and went off once in three times with the
intonation of a four-pounder.</p>

<p>"Hang the difference," says the Adjutant; "it will do."</p>

<p>"Must do," the second replies; and so paying for the
tool, and swallowing down a fresh invoice of <i>ardiente</i>, the
fighting men start to muster up their opponents, whom they
found armed and equipped, upon a footing equal to the
other side, or pretty near it, the Lieutenant having a little
<i>heavier</i> piece, with a bore into which a gill measure might
be thrown.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;the difference!" cried seconds and principals.</p>

<p>"Let's fight, not talk," says the Adjutant.</p>

<p>"That's my opinion, gentlemen, exactly," the Lieutenant responds.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere!"</p>

<p>"Better get out into the chaparral," say the cautious
seconds; "don't want a crowd. Come on!" continue the
seconds, very valorously; "let's fight!"</p>

<p>"Here's the ground!" cries one, as the parties reach a
chaparral, a mile or so from town; "here is our ground!"</p>

<p>The principals stared around as if rather uncertain about
that, for the bushes were so thick and high that precious
little <i>ground</i> was visible.</p>

<p>"It ain't worth while, gentlemen, to toss up for positions,
is it?" says the Adjutant's second.</p>

<p>"No," cry both principals. "Measure off the <i>ground</i>, if
you can find it; let us go to work."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" says the Adjutant's second.</p>

<p>"Measure off thirty paces," the Lieutenant's second responds.</p>

<p>"No, ten!" cry the principals.</p>

<p>"Twenty paces or no fight!" insists the Adjutant's
second. "Twenty paces; one, two, three&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the seconds trod off as best they could the distance,
the pieces were loaded, the several bipeds took a drink all
around from an ample jug of the R. G. they brought for
the purpose, and then began the memorable duel. The
principals were placed in their respective positions, to rake
down each other; and from a safer point of the compass
the seconds gave the word.</p>

<p>"Bang-g-g!" went the Adjutant's piece, knocking him
down flat as a hoe-cake.</p>

<p>"F-f-f-izzy!" and the Lieutenant's piece hung fire.</p>

<p>The seconds flew to their men; a parley took place
upon a "question" whether the Lieutenant had a <i>right</i>
to prime and fire again, or not. The Adjutant being set
upon his pins; declared himself ready and willing to let the
Lieutenant blaze away! The point was finally settled by
loading up the Adjutant's piece, and priming that of the
Lieutenant, placing the men, and giving the word,</p>

<p>"One, two, three!"</p>

<p>"Wang-g-g-g!"</p>

<p>"Fiz-a-bang-g-g-g!"</p>

<p>The seconds ran, or hobbled forward, each to his man,
both being down; but whether by concussion, recoil of their
fusees, force of the liquor, or weakness of the knee-pans,
was a hard fact to solve.</p>

<p>"Hurt, Wash.?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" cries the Adjutant, getting up.</p>

<p>"Hit, Dick?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir!</i>" shouts the Lieutenant; "good as new!"</p>

<p>"Set 'em up!"</p>

<p>"Take your places, gentlemen!" cry the seconds.</p>

<p>All ready. Wang! bang! go the pieces, and down ker-<i>chug</i>
go both men again. The seconds rush forward, raise
their men, all safe, load up again, take a drink, all right.</p>

<p>"Make ready, take aim, fire!"</p>

<p>"Wang-g-g!"</p>

<p>"Bang-g-g!"</p>

<p>Both down again, the Lieutenant's coat-tail slightly dislocated,
and the Adjutant dangerously wounded in the leg
of his breeches! Both parties getting very mad, very tired,
and very anxious to try it on at ten paces. Seconds object,
pieces loaded up again, principals arranged, and,</p>

<p>"One, two, three, fire!"</p>

<p>"Wang-g-g-g!"</p>

<p>"Bang-g-g!"</p>

<p>All down&mdash;load up again&mdash;take a drink&mdash;fire! and down
they go again. It is very natural to suppose that all this
firing attracted somebody's attention, and somebody came
poking around to see what it was all about; and just then,
as four or five Mexicans came peeping and peering through
the chaparral, Dick and Wash. let drive&mdash;Bang-g! wang-g!
and though it seemed impossible to hit one another, the
slugs, ricochetting over and through the chaparral, knocked
down two Mexicans, who yelled sanguinary murder, and the
rest of their friends took to their heels. The seconds, not
<i>quite</i> so "tight" as the principals, took warning in time to
evacuate the field of honor, Lieut. Dick's second taking him
one way, and Ajt. Wash.'s friend going another, just as a
"Corporal's Guard" made their appearance to arrest the
<i>rioters</i>. In spite of the poor Mexicans' protestations, or
endeavors to make out a true case, they were taken up and
carried to the Guard-House, for shooting one another, and
raising a row in general. A night's repose brought the
morning's reflection, when the previous day's performances
were laughed at, if not forgotten. Wash, and Dick became
good friends, of course, and cemented the bonds of fraternity
in the bloody work of a day or two afterwards, in
storming Monterey.</p>

<p>There is not a lady living, but should possess themselves of a
copy of this work at once. It will give you all better meals and
make your cost of living less, and keep your husbands, sons, and
brothers in an excellent humor. It is recommended by thousands,
and is the <i>best</i> and only complete Book on all kinds of Cookery extant.
It is written so that all can understand it. It is taking the place
of all other Cook Books, for a person possessing "WIDDIFIELD'S
NEW COOK BOOK" needs no other, as a copy of this is worth all
the other books, called Cook Books, in the World.</p>

<p><i>Read what the Editor of the Dollar Newspaper says about it.</i></p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"The authoress of this work long enjoyed great celebrity with the
best families in Philadelphia as the most thoroughly informed lady
in her profession in this country. Her Establishment, on Ninth
above Spruce street, has long enjoyed the patronage of the best
livers in our city. The receipts cover almost every variety of cake
or dish, and every species of cooking. One great advantage which
this book enjoys over almost every other is the simplicity with which
the ingredients are set forth, and the comparatively moderate cost
at which particular receipts may be got up. In most cook books the
directions cover so large a cost, that to common livers the directions
had almost as well not be given. This objection has been measurably
removed in this new volume. Another important matter is, no
receipts are contained in it but those fully tested, not only by the
author, but by cooks and housekeepers most competent to judge.
The volume opens with directions for soup, for fish, oysters, meat,
poultry, etc. In addition to all this, much attention has been given
to directions for the preparation of dishes for the sick and convalescent.
Mr. Peterson has issued the volume in handsome style,
wisely, as we think, using large type and good paper. The book is
sold at, or will be sent to any part of the Union, free of postage, on
receipt of One Dollar."</p>

<p><i>Read what the Editor of the Saturday Evening Post says of it.</i></p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"A number of good books on this subject have been published
lately, but this is unquestionably the best that we have ever seen
Its superiority is in the clearness, and brevity, and the practical
directness of the receipts; they are easily understood and followed.
The book looks like what it is, the ripe fruit of many years' successful
practice. The establishment of Mrs. Widdifield has for many
years held the first rank in Philadelphia for the unvarying excellence
of every article there made; and now she crowns her well deserved
celebrity by giving to the world <i>the best book that has been written on
the subject of cookery</i>. The clear type in which the publisher presents
it is no slight addition to its value."</p>

<p><i>Read what the Editor of the Public Ledger says of it.</i></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"<span class="smcap">A Valuable Work.</span>&mdash;Next to having something to eat is
having it cooked in a style fit to be eaten. Every housekeeper does
not understand this art, and, probably, only for want of a little elementary
teaching. This want is easily supplied, for T. B. Peterson has
just published Mrs. Widdifield's New Cook Book, in which the experience
of that celebrated person in this line is given so clearly and
with such precise details, that any housekeeper of sufficient capacity
to undertake the management of household affairs, can make herself
an accomplished caterer for the table without serving an apprenticeship
to the business. The book is published in one volume, the
typography good, and paper excellent, with as much real useful information
in the volume as would be worth a dozen times its price.

<p>THIS CELEBRATED AND BEAUTIFUL WORK is published complete in one large
volume, of over 300 pages, paper cover, price FIFTY CENTS; or the work is handsomely
bound in one volume, cloth, gilt, price ONE DOLLAR.</p>

<p>ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES OF THE FORGED WILL! will be sold in
a short time, and it will have a run and popularity second only to Uncle Tom's Cabin.
The Press everywhere are unanimous in its praise, as being one of the most powerfully
written works in the language.</p>

<p>THE FORGED WILL is truly a celebrated work. It has been running through
the columns of the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper, where it has been appearing for ten
weeks, and has proved itself to be one of the most popular nouvelettes that has ever
appeared in the columns of any newspaper in this country. Before the fourth paper appeared,
the back numbers, (although several thousand extra of the three former numbers
were printed,) could not be obtained at any price, and the publishers of the paper
were forced to issue a Supplement sheet of the first three papers of it, for new subscribers
to their paper, which induced the publisher to make an arrangement with the popular
author to bring it out in a beautiful style for the thousands that wish it in book form.</p>

<p>If Emerson Bennett had never written his many delightful and thrilling stories of
border life, of prairie scenes, and Indian warfare, this new story of the '<span class="smcap">Forged Will</span>'
would have placed his name on the record as one of the best of American novelists. The
scenes, principally, of this most captivating novel, are laid in the city of New York; and
most glowingly the author pictures to us how the guilty may, for a time, escape the
justice of the law, but only to feel the heavy hand of retribution sooner or later; how
vice may, for a time, triumph over virtue, but only for a time; how crime may lie concealed,
until its very security breeds exposure; how true virtue gives way to no temptation,
but bears the ills of life with patience, hoping for a better day, and rejoices
triumphant in the end. In short, from base hypocrisy he tears the veil that hides its
huge deformity, and gives a true picture of life as it exists in the crowded city. We do
cordially recommend this book for its excellent moral. It is one that should be circulated,
for it <i>must</i> do good.</p>

<p>Price for the complete work, in one volume, in paper cover, Fifty Cents only; or a
finer edition, printed on thicker and better paper, and handsomely bound in one volume,

<p class='center'>READ THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS OF THE PRESS:</p>

<p>"We have perused this work with some attention, and do not hesitate to pronounce
it one of the very best productions of the talented author. The scenes are laid in Texas,
and the adjoining frontier. There is not a page that does not glow with thrilling and
interesting incident, and will well repay the reader for the time occupied in perusing it.
The characters are most admirably drawn, and are perfectly natural throughout. We
have derived so much gratification from the perusal of this charming novel, that we are
anxious to make our readers share it with us; and, at the same time, to recommend it
to be read by all persons who are fond of romantic adventures. Mr. Bennett is a spirited
and vigorous writer, and his works deserve to be generally read; not only because
they are well written, but that they are, in most part, taken from events connected
with the history of our own country, from which much valuable information is derived,
and should, therefore, have a double claim upon our preference, over those works where
the incidents are gleaned from the romantic legends of old castles, and foreign climes.
The book is printed on fine paper, and is in every way got up in a style highly creditable
to the enterprising publisher."</p>

<p>"It is a spirited tale of frontier life, of which 'Clara Moreland' is the sequel and
conclusion. Mr. Bennett seems to delight in that field of action and adventure, where
Cooper won his laurels; and which is perhaps the most captivating to the general mind
of all the walks of fiction. There has been, so far, we think, a steady improvement in
his style and stories; and his popularity, as a necessary consequence, has been and is increasing.
One great secret of the popularity of these out-door novels, as we may call
them, is that there is a freshness and simplicity of the open air and natural world about
them&mdash;free from the closeness, intensity and artificiality of the gas-lighted world revealed
in works that treat of the vices and dissipations of large cities."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Saturday Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>"This is one of the best productions of Mr. Bennett. The scenes are in and near
Texas. Every page glows with thrilling interest, and the characters are well drawn and
sustained. An interesting love plot runs through the book, which gives a faithful representation
of life in the far South-West. Mr. Peterson has issued <span class="smcap">Viola</span> in his usual
neat style, and it is destined to have a great run."&mdash;<i>Clinton Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"We have received the above work and found time to give it an examination. The
scenes are laid mostly in Texas, and pictured with all the vividness for which the author
is so celebrated. Those who are particularly fond of wild and romantic adventures
may safely calculate upon finding 'Viola' suited to their taste. It is well written and
handsomely printed."&mdash;<i>Daily Journal, Chicago, Ill.</i></p>

<p>"It is a very interesting book. The scenes of this most exciting and interesting Romance
are found in Texas before and during the late Mexican war. It is written with
much spirit and pathos, and abounds in stirring incidents and adventures, and has an
interesting and romantic love-plot interwoven with it; and is a faithful representation
of 'Life in the Far South-West.' The author of '<span class="smcap">Viola</span>,' will rank among the most
popular of American Novelists, and aided by the great energy and enterprise of his publisher,
T. B. Peterson, is fast becoming a general favorite."&mdash;<i>Gazette, Rhinebeck, N. Y.</i></p>

<p>"This thrilling and interesting novel&mdash;equal to anything the celebrated author ever
wrote&mdash;has been issued in a fifty cent volume; and we would advise every one who
wants to get the value of his money, to get the book. Bennett's works are the most interesting
of any now published."&mdash;<i>Western Emporium, Germantown, Ohio.</i></p>

<p>"This historical romance is the most powerfully wrought work which the indomitable
genius of the author has ever produced; and is amply sufficient of itself to stamp the
writer as a powerful man. The startling schemes and plots which preceded the overthrow
of the great Roman Republic, afford ample scope for his well-practised pen, and
we may add he has not only been fortunate in producing a work of such masterly pretensions,
but Mr. Herbert is equally so in the good taste, energy, and tact of his enterprising
publisher. The book is admirably brought out, and altogether may be set down
as one of Peterson's 'great hits' in literature."</p>

<p class='center'><i>From the Philadelphia Daily Pennsylvanian, of Sept. 8th, 1853.</i></p>

<p>"The author has made one of his happiest efforts, and given in this volume a tale
which will stand the test of the most rigid criticism, and be read by all lovers of literature
that embodies the true, the thrilling, the powerful, and the sublime. In fact, we
would have thought it impossible to produce such a tale of the Republic in these latter
days; but here we have it&mdash;Sergius Cataline, Cethegus, Cassius, and the rest of that
dark band of conspirators, are here displayed in their true portraits. Those who have
read 'Sallust' with care, will recognize the truthful portraiture at a glance, and see the
heroes of deep and treacherous villainy dressed out in their proper devil-doing character.
On the other hand, we have Cicero, the orator and true friend of the Commonwealth
of Rome. We have also his noble <ins title="cotemporaries">contemporaries</ins> and coadjutors, all in this volume.
Would that space permitted for a more extended notice, but we are compelled to forbear.
One thing is certain&mdash;if this book contained nothing more than the story of Paullus
Arvina, it would be a tale of thrilling interest."</p>

<p class='center'><i>From the Cleveland, Ohio, True Democrat, of Sept. 8th, 1853.</i></p>

<p>"Those who have perused the former works of this distinguished author, will not
fail to procure this book&mdash;It is a thrilling romance, and the characters brought forward,
and the interest with which they are constantly invested, will insure for it a
great run."</p>

<p class='center'><i>From the Philadelphia City Item, of Sept. 10th, 1853.</i></p>

<p>"The Roman Traitor demands earnest commendation. It is a powerful production&mdash;perhaps
the highest effort of the brilliant and successful author. A thorough historian
and a careful thinker, he is well qualified to write learnedly of any period of the world's
history. The book is published in tasteful style, and will adorn the centre-table."</p>

<p class='center'><i>From the Boston Evening Transcript, of Sept. 6th, 1853.</i></p>

<p>"This is a powerfully written tale, filled with the thrilling incidents which have made
the period of which it speaks one of the darkest in the history of the Roman Republic.
The lovers of excitement will find in its pages ample food to gratify a taste for the darker
phases of life's drama."</p>

<p class='center'><i>From the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch, of Sept. 4th, 1853.</i></p>

<p>"Cataline's conspiracy has been selected by Mr. Herbert as the subject of this story.
Taking the historical incidents as recorded by the most authentic authors, he has woven
around them a net-work of incident, love and romance, which is stirring and exciting.
The faithful manner in which the author has adhered to history, and the graphic style
in which his descriptions abound, stamp this as one of the most excellent of his many
successful novels."</p>

<h3><span style="font-size:200%;">CLARA MORELAND.</span></h3>


<h4>BY EMERSON BENNETT.<br />
<span style="font-size:smaller">Price Fifty Cents in Paper Cover; or, One Dollar in Cloth, Gilt.</span></h4>

<hr />

<p class='center'>READ THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"This is decidedly the best novel Mr. Bennett has written. He tells his story well,
and while leading the reader over the prairies of Texas into the haunts of the wild
Indians, or among the equally savage bands of lawless men, that once were the terror
of that country; he presents the remarkable transitions in the fortunes of his hero, in
a manner which, though often startling, are yet within the bounds of probability. His
dialogue is good, growing easily out of the situation and condition of the interlocutors,
and presenting occasionally, especially in response, an epigrammatic poise, that is
worthy of all praise. The plot abounds with adventure, and presents many scenes of
startling interest, while the denouement is such as to amply satisfy the most fastidious
reader's ideas of poetical justice. We would add a few words of praise for the excellent
style in which this book is gotten up. It is well printed on good paper, and bound in a
manner to correspond with the quality of its typography."&mdash;<i>Arthur's Home Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"This is the best of Mr. Bennett's books. It is a brilliant and thrilling production,
and will particularly interest all who love to read of life in the West and South-West.
A love story runs through the volume, lending grace and finish to it. Mr. Peterson has
issued the book in very handsome style; the type is new and of honest size, the binding
is strong and pretty, the paper is firm and white, and the embellishments are eminently
creditable. Clara Moreland should command a large sale."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia City Item.</i></p>

<p>"On looking more carefully through this racy, spirited narrative of thrilling scenes
and well-told adventures, we meet with beauties that escape a casual observation. Mr.
Bennett is a keen discoverer of character, and paints his portraits so true to nature as
to carry the reader with him through all his wild wanderings and with unabated
interest. The author of 'Clara Moreland' takes rank among the most popular American
novelists, and aided by the great energy of his publisher is fast becoming a general
favorite."&mdash;<i>McMackin's Model Saturday Courier.</i></p>

<p>"Emerson Bennett has written some very creditable productions. This is one of his
longest, and is well received. Mr. Bennett is a favorite author with Western readers.
It is illustrated and well printed."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper.</i></p>

<p>"It is a tale of wild border life and exciting incident, bustle, and turmoil."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
North American.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Bennett is, in some measure, a new man in this section of the universe, and, as
such, our reading public are bound to give him a cordial greeting, not only for this, but
for the sake of that wide-spread popularity which he has achieved in the mighty West,
and more especially for the intrinsic excellence that distinguishes his glowing, brilliant
productions, of which 'Clara Moreland' may be pronounced the best."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Saturday Courier.</i></p>

<p>"This work is of the most exciting character, and will be enjoyed by all who have a
cultivated taste."&mdash;<i>Baltimore Sun.</i></p>

<p>"The scene of this interesting Romance lies in Texas before or during the late war
with Mexico. It is written with a great deal of spirit; it abounds in stirring incidents
and adventures, has a good love-plot interwoven with it, and is in many respects a
faithful representation of Life in the Far South-West. Mr. Bennett is destined to great
popularity, especially at the South and West. His publisher has issued this book in a
very handsome style."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Evening Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>"This is a thrilling story of frontier life, full of incident, and graphically sketched.
It is published in a good style."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>

<p>"This is a spirited narrative of stirring scenes, by Emerson Bennett. Those who love
daring adventure and hair-breadth escapes will find it an engaging book."&mdash;<i>Detroit,
Mich., Paper.</i></p>

<p>"It is a thrilling narrative of South-Western adventure, illustrated by numerous
engravings."&mdash;<i>Detroit, Mich., Paper.</i></p>

<p>"It is a wondrous story of thrilling adventures and hair-breadth escapes, the scene
of which is laid in the South-West. The book is illustrated with engravings representing
some of the exciting events narrated by the writer."&mdash;<i>Detroit, Mich., Paper.</i></p>

<p>"It is a work replete with stirring adventure. Romance, incident, and accident, are
blended together so as to form a highly interesting work of 334 pages."&mdash;<i>New York
Picayune.</i></p>

and Bookselling Establishment, is at<br />
<b>No. 102 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.</b></p>
<hr class='small' />

<p>T. B. PETERSON has the satisfaction to announce to the public, that he has removed
to the new and spacious BROWN STONE BUILDING, NO. 102 CHESTNUT STREET,
just completed by the city authorities on the Girard Estate, known as the most central
and best situation in the city of Philadelphia. As it is the Model Book Store of the
Country, we will describe it: It is the largest, most spacious, and best arranged Retail
and Wholesale Cheap Book and Publishing Establishment in the United States. It is
built, by the Girard Estate, of Connecticut sand-stone, in a richly ornamental style.
The whole front of the lower story, except that taken up by the doorway, is occupied by
two large plate glass windows, a single plate to each window, costing together over three
thousand dollars. On entering and looking up, you find above you a ceiling sixteen
feet high; while, on gazing before, you perceive a vista of One Hundred and Fifty-Seven
feet. The retail counters extend back for eighty feet, and, being double, afford counter-room
of One Hundred and Sixty feet in length. There is also <i>over Three Thousand feet
of shelving in the retail part of the store alone</i>. This part is devoted to the retail business,
and as it is the most spacious in the country, furnishes also the best and largest
assortment of all kinds of books to be found in the country. It is fitted up in the most
superb style; the shelvings are all painted in Florence white, with gilded cornices for
the book shelves.</p>

<p>Behind the retail part of the store, at about ninety feet from the entrance, is the
counting-room, twenty feet square, railed neatly off, and surmounted by a most beautiful
dome of stained glass. In the rear of this is the wholesale and packing department,
extending a further distance of about sixty feet, with desks and packing counters for the
establishment, etc., etc. All goods are received and shipped from the back of the store,
having a fine avenue on the side of Girard Bank for the purpose, leading out to Third
Street, so as not to interfere with and block up the front of the store on Chestnut Street.
The cellar, of the entire depth of the store, is filled with printed copies of Mr. Peterson's
own publications, printed from his own stereotype plates, of which he generally keeps
on hand an edition of a thousand each, making a stock, of his own publications alone,
of over three hundred thousand volumes, constantly on hand.</p>

<p>T. B. PETERSON is warranted in saying, that he is able to offer such inducements
to the Trade, and all others, to favor him with their orders, as cannot be excelled by any
book establishment in the country. In proof of this, T. B. PETERSON begs leave to
refer to his great facilities of getting stock of all kinds, his dealing direct with all the
Publishing Houses in the country, and also to his own long list of Publications, consisting
of the best and most popular productions of the most talented authors of the United
States and Great Britain, and to his very extensive stock, embracing every work, new or
old, published in the United States.</p>

<p>T. B. PETERSON will be most happy to supply all orders for any books at all, no
matter by whom published, in advance of all others, and at publishers' lowest cash
prices. He respectfully invites Country Merchants, Booksellers, Pedlars, Canvassers,
Agents, the Trade, Strangers in the city, and the public generally, to call and examine
his extensive collection of cheap and standard publications of all kinds, comprising a
most magnificent collection of CHEAP BOOKS, MAGAZINES, NOVELS, STANDARD
and POPULAR WORKS of all kinds, BIBLES, PRAYER BOOKS, ANNUALS, GIFT
BOOKS, ILLUSTRATED WORKS, ALBUMS and JUVENILE WORKS of all kinds,
GAMES of all kinds, to suit all ages, tastes, etc., which he is selling to his customers
and the public at much lower prices than they can be purchased elsewhere. Being located
at No. 102 CHESTNUT Street, the great thoroughfare of the city, and BUYING
his stock outright in large quantities, and not selling on commission, he can and will
sell them on such terms as will defy all competition. Call and examine our stock, you
will find it to be the best, largest and cheapest in the city; and you will also be sure to
find all the <i>best, latest, popular, and cheapest works</i> published in this country or elsewhere,
for sale at the lowest prices.</p>
